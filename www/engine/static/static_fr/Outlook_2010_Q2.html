<h2>Q2 2010 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2010 Investment Trends Survey reports a continuing confidence in the Canadian commercial real estate market. The survey results suggest a continued confidence in the Retail and Industrial sectors, whilst there is continued support to the Multi-Family sector and caution within the Office market. The attitude of buyers and sellers is shifting to a more realistic notion of the overall market. However, although liquidity has improved, the availability of financing is still tight and lending terms are not as favorable as they were previously.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
As anticipated, the commercial real estate market is experiencing a slower recovery than other sectors of the economy, but with REITs re-entering the marketplace as active buyers, there has been a lot more activity. Improved availability of financing and spreads are encouraging, but continued conservative lending parameters have left some local and regional investors on the sidelines.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Canadian market is still holding up better than the US market with a much smaller volume of distressed sales. However, should the office market continue to be soft, more product in less prime locations may become targets of distressed sales.

The location barometer summarizes the relative attractiveness of eight cities across Canada, as investment locations. This barometer measures the appeal of each city surveyed by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example in the leading centre, Ottawa, the 295 responses indicated an average of 2.3 buyers for every seller for all the property types surveyed. The location barometer indicates that, since Q1 2010, sentiment has become more 'bullish' in Ottawa, Calgary and Montreal, remained the same in Toronto, Edmonton and Halifax, and turned more 'bearish' in Vancouver and Quebec City. Overall however, there has been a very significant shift over the past twelve months, with all locations recording a substantial increase in the momentum ratio and all markets indicating more buyers than sellers. The largest shifts were noted for Calgary, Montreal, Quebec City, Edmonton and Halifax, which all recorded negative ratios (more sellers than buyers) in Q2 2009.

Attitudes are shifting toward a move stable or positive attitude across the country, which is a significant shift from Q2 2009, when there was a decidedly negative response across the country. One of the largest changes from investors is the Calgary market, which has seen a 17% shift in positive responses to the Downtown Class AA Office market. This aligns with the overall sentiment for the Canadian real estate market, with liquidity and investors re-entering the market and offering a brighter outlook.

The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 47.1% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 35.1% (up from 13.0% in Q3 2009) increase over the next 12 months. The greatest caution in the Investor Outlook is expressed in Downtown Class "B" Office with 17.9% of respondents predicting that values will fall during the next 12 months.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=113"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/04.gif"></a>Consistent with the overall trend in this quarter's results, respondents are becoming more optimistic about the market, with the majority of suggesting a slight downward trend. The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. There is relatively narrow 'band width' of opinions for each of the product types, with the biggest spread being 200 bps. The lowest 'going in' yields continue in the multi-unit residential sector in the 5.2% to 6.81% range, this being 10 to 30 bps less then 12 months ago. Although there is optimism overall, there are also a number of product classes and locations suggesting a static view compared to three months ago.

Only 4 of the 32 product location combinations reported an increase in IRRs (all in the Multi-Unit Residential product class), 19 reported no change and 9 reported downward momentum since Q1 2010.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/06.gif"></a>The current Property Type Barometer indicates that the most desirable asset class is Food Anchored Retail Strip, with 7.8 buyers for every sellers, up from 6.5 in Q1 2010. The previous quarter's most desirable product type was Tier I Regional Mall, but its desirability lessened from 8.0 in Q1 2010 to 6.2 buyers in Q2 2010. Multi-Tenant Industrial, Power Centre, Multi-Unit Residential and Tier II Regional Malls all indicated positive momentum over the past quarter. Single Tenant Industrial, Downtown Class "AA" Office, Suburban Class "A" Office and Downtown Class "B" Office have lost momentum since Q1 2010. Currently the least desirable products appear to be Downtown Class "B" Office, Single Tenant Industrial and Suburban Class "B" Office, the latter being least desirable with 3.6 sellers for every buyer.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/07.gif"></a>The office vacancy outlook is a significant feature of this investment class and the respondent views for the next three months remain pessimistic. The barometer suggests negative momentum for all markets, with exception of Halifax Suburban Class "A" Office, Vancouver Downtown Class "AA" Office and Ottawa Suburban Class "A" and "B" Office. Not surprisingly, given the new construction and sublease markets in the Calgary and Toronto, projections continue to be bearish.

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R404&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3,4,1,5,6,2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/08.gif"></a>The Barometer for office investments provides insight into how investor demand has shifted over the past 12 months. Over the past year there has been consistent demand for both Downtown Class "AA" and Suburban Class "A" Office product, while demand for both Downtown Class "B" product and Suburban Class "B" Office has decreased. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/09.gif"></a>The valuation parameters graph for downtown Class "AA" Office indicates that respondents expressed primarily positive sentiment for Class "AA" product, with static or lower 'going in' yields and overall cap rates. The largest decreases in OCRs and IRR yield requirements were noted for Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/10.gif"></a>Our Q2 retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Food Anchored Strips and Power Centres. The property barometer indicated earlier that retail products were among the most desirable asset classes across the country. In Toronto there are 6.3 buyers for every seller for a Tier I regional Mall, compared to 5.8 buyers in Q4 2009. The graph to the right (Slide 11 Tier I Regional Mall Historic Valuation Parameters Toronto) highlights a similar overall trend as the market in general, with the yield improving slightly to 6.1% OCR in Q2 2010.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
As noted in the property barometer, Food Anchored Strip is the most desirable asset class at present. Current yield expectations for Food Anchored Strips are evidenced by the recent transaction at Quarry Park Marketplace in Calgary, which suggested an OCR of 7.01% and an IRR of 8.32%, both consistent with recent survey parameters.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/11.gif"></a>The property barometer suggests that industrial assets are still considered to be two of the most desirable asset classes, with Single Tenant Industrial having 3.0 buyers per seller and Multi-Tenant Industrial 2.7 buyers per seller. The continued slowdown in the economy has led to a number of plant closures, which has increased vacancy and put downward pressure on rental rate projections. Rental growth is projected to be strongest in Quebec City, followed closely by Vancouver and Ottawa over the next 12 months. In major manufacturing cities such as Toronto and Montreal, rents are projected to shrink over the next 12 months. The projection over the next 36 months, although positive, is very modest.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/12.gif"></a>The valuation parameters for Single Tenant Industrial suggest a relatively tight range of OCRs across the country, with a low of 6.6% in Vancouver and a high of 8.0% in Halifax. However, 7 of the 8 markets surveyed suggest downward pressure on OCR's from the previous quarter.
</p>

<p>
Respondents also suggest downward momentum for multi-tenant industrial, with five of the eight markets indicating downward pressure on the OCR's.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/13.gif"></a>Multiple Unit Residential remains one of the most desirable asset classes, with the property barometer suggesting 3.1 buyers per seller. There is still a strong demand in the marketplace for apartment units, which have been buoyed in some markets by net migration during the economic slowdown, as workers flow into markets with potential opportunities. Five of the eight markets surveyed suggest that demand for Multiple Unit Residential has increased compared to the previous quarter. All markets are positive reflecting more buyers than sellers, with Ottawa and Montreal leading the way with 13.0 and 7.0 buyers per seller respectively.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=113&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q2/14.gif"></a>Yield ranges for Multiple Unit Residential are still among the lowest in all asset classes, due to stability in cash flows and low vacancy, with Vancouver leading the way at 5.2% OCR to 6.8% OCR in Halifax, suggesting a relatively tight range across the country.
</p>



<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2010 Investment trends Survey offers continued optimism for the Canadian Commercial Real Estate market in general. The perceived outlook from the survey respondents is generally positive and, at the very least, offers the prospect of a stable real estate market heading into Q3 2010. This view is supported by a number of recent transactions in the market place, particularly from retail and industrial perspective, which mirror the Q2 survey responses. With more major buyers re-entering the market and the improved liquidity, it is likely that the current transactional pace will continue over the short term.
