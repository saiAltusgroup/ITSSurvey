<h2>Q3 2011 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q3 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market continues to successfully weather the global turmoil and for the most part has rebounded to a stable level. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due mostly to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, 'normal' means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability of product, deep pools of equity and finally, active bidding for choice assets.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the commercial market has again moved into imbalance, due to a supply issue. Major property owners are highly motivated to buy because the Pension Funds, Life Companies and REITS are awash with cash and private investors again have access to low cost mortgage money. The lack of actively marketed real estate is causing multiple bids in all asset classes, which has again fueled significant and rapid compression in OCRs and IRRs. As a result, in in the last three quarters, reported yields for most asset classes have decreased to within 10 bps to 30 bps of those experienced in the last cycle, which peaked in late 2007. Particularly Single-Tenant Industrial rates in some markets have now reached the level last obtained at the peak in late 2007.</p>

</p>

<p>
The chart on the right shows the Cost of Debt Outlook for the next three months. The majority of respondents anticipated "no change", and this response increased by 58% from the previous quarter. There still remains a cautious outlook among many investors about cost of debt "increasing", however the response rate for this category declined by about 27%. Generally the investment trends survey suggests a balanced view of interest rate risk: neither overly optimistic nor too pessimistic. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/02.png"></a>
The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of eight major Canadian markets as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investor preference for each city by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. Currently the most favoured centre is Ottawa, with 3.1 buyers for every seller for all the property types. The ratio has doubled from the previous quarter (1.5) and now has surpassed Calgary, Vancouver, and Toronto. Traditionally Ottawa has been one of the preferred markets given the stabilizing effect of the Federal Government presence. However in the past two quarters Ottawa fell in preference perhaps due to perceived risk based upon the possibility of federal cuts to budget and employment in that market. That risk has subsided as budget cuts are not expected to have a dramatic and immediate effect in the city. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
Nearly all locations experienced positive momentum from previous quarter. The notable exception is Quebec City, which fell from second rank (1.8) in Q2 to last position this quarter. This is nor because confidence Quebec City has declined, but rather that interest in other the other markets has increased.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=19"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/03.png"></a>
This quarter the product that gained traction after a period of interim slump is Downtown Multiple Unit Residential. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 68.4% of respondents forecast an increase in value parameters in the next 12 months, while 0% anticipated any decrease. This befits this sector given the surge in leasing activity in downtown cores of major centres, resulting in increased hiring activity for the near-term. This reveals a more positive outlook for this asset class since it suggests stability of this group at minimum with potential for increased asset values. 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=118"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/04.png"></a>
The graph of OCRs compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. In the third quarter of 2011 OCRs remained stable for the most part in all sectors. A notable decrease in rates was observed in Suburban Multiple Unit Residential sector in most locations. Additionally, on the basis of location, Quebec City also saw a decline in rates for Downtown Office and Single Tenant Industrial. 
</p>

<p>
The range of opinion of rates has remained relatively consistent from 5.0% to 8.0% for most regions. Outliers were observed within multi-tenant residential in the Vancouver market with the lowest rate of 4.0%. This can be attributed to the continued increase in cost of home-ownership in that market, which results in increased demand for rental properties. Highest rates were observed consistently for Single Tenant Industrials in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax, all of which were over 8.0%. This was expected since the manufacturing sector in the eastern Provinces are still in recovery stage, especially in light of the high Canadian dollar and increased trade barriers under the current US administration. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=118"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/05.png"></a>
In terms of IRRs a continued drop in rates is being expressed in our respondent categories as indicated in the accompanying chart. The typical range is from 5.5% at the low end for Suburban Multiple Unit Residential in Vancouver to 10.0% at the upper end for Downtown Class "AA" Office and Single Tenant Industrial in Montreal and Quebec City. The broader range observed in Quebec is not unusual as investor sentiment tends to vary more in this region. One possible reason is the more diverse range of available product in this market. 
</p>

<p>
In summary, the overall investor sentiment is of increased confidence resulting in decreasing rates from the previous quarter, with some exceptions observed in certain asset classes and in some locations. In all western markets, Toronto and Ottawa the average rate of return in all sectors is below 8.0%, which is a significant improvement from the two previous quarters.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/06.png"></a>
There has been a dramatic repositioning of property type demand in the third quarter of 2011. The lead position has reverted back to Tier 1 Regional Mall (9.2 buyers for every seller) which had dropped to fourth place in previous quarter. The hypothesis made previously was that given its upward trajectory in values past several quarters and resulting low yields, investors were seeking more affordable and higher yielding and/or riskier products in industrial, residential, and office sectors. The current quarter results suggest that Tier 1 Regional Mall and Retail sector in general has again become the "Flavor of the quarter" among investors. Possible reasons for this can be attributed to the continued strong performance of the Canadian economy, the strong per capita spending in retail among households and the ongoing economic crisis and bearish market in the USA, which is 'scaring' investors back to safe and secure assets with strong historical performance benchmarks.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The others in the Top 5 positions include Multi-tenant Residential (up from 6th), Downtown Class "AA" office, Suburban Multi Unit Residential and Single Tenant Industrial. Office products overall have seen positive momentum ratio change, which suggests that demand for this sector remains high. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
An interesting observation is that Suburban Class "B" Office has elevated to third last position from last in Q2. It appears that this sub-sector is starting to see some improvements as vacancy falls and demand increases from foreign companies that wish to gain a foothold in the Canadian market as suggested by some realtors. It will be interesting to see if this rise continues in to the next quarter. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/07.png"></a>
Two dramatic changes can be noted in the Product/Market Barometer chart. Ottawa has roared back with a vengeance in to the top 15 sector in several asset classes. This aligns with our preceding discussion of the resurging demand in this market. Secondly, retail products (particularly Tier I Regional Malls) are back in favour in the top 15 after having virtually disappeared from this group in Q3 (27% momentum ratio). 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/08.png"></a>
The demand for Downtown Class "AA" Office investments continues to gain strength, on the heels of positive trends in the key Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary markets. The Barometer indicates increased momentum during the next 3 months in several downtown locations, particularly in Calgary, which has seen a dramatic decrease in vacancy as the Oil and Gas sector increased output and hiring activity. Notwithstanding the aforementioned increasing appeal of the Ottawa market among investors, some caution is expressed within the Office sector in this market as vacancy is expected to increase over the next three months.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=118"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/09.png"></a>
The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Calgary market. The market experienced a sustained bull run from Q4 2003 (8.4% OCR) to Q3 2007 (5.8%), then retreated until Q1 2010 (7.1%) and has recovered to an average OCR of 6.2% in Q3 2011, positioning this asset class within 40 bps of the price peak in Q3 2007. Complimenting the preceding sentiment of reduced vacancy, we noted a sharp rise in rates per square foot and declining rates for IRR and TCR. The market has improved largely due to increased hiring within the Oil and Gas sector, aggressive marketing and leasing of vacant space in the core and major national and international corporations trying to establish a foothold in this region, given the relative affordability of premium quality space. 
</p>
 
<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/11.png"></a><a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/10.png"></a>
While the previous quarter response suggested a shift away from retail by investors, the current quarter results suggest a reversal of this attitude. While all the Retail asset classes indicated in the accompanying chart remain in the same relative position as the previous quarter, the momentum ratio for Tier 1 Regional Mall, Food Anchored Retail Strip and Power Centre has increased by nearly threefold.
</p>

<p>
A possible reason for this is the continued bearish and recessionary US market that is perceived to have some bearing on the market in Canada. So investors, especially REITs, Pension Funds, Life companies, may be taking a cautionary stance and directing funds back towards retail sector, despite its lower yields in comparison to other asset classes. The most favored sector in retail appears to be Tier 1 Regional Mall for all major cities.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=118"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/12.png"></a>
The Historical Valuation Parameters for Tier 1 Regional Mall in Toronto suggests declining IRR, OCR, and TCR from the previous quarter. Given such low yields, such assets remain attainable only for large institutional investors - such as pension funds and REITs - who prefer this asset for its security and consistent cash flow.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=14,12,13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/14.png"></a><a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=14,12,13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/13.png"></a>
Industrial properties remain highly ranked assets, with Single-Tenant Industrial in Edmonton being ranked in first position in the accompanying Property Type and Product/Market Type Barometer charts. This is attributed to the increase in oil sands activity in the region and lack of quality product relative to resulting demand, which is expected to increase further over the next quarter. This has already resulted in new construction starts that are in the pipeline for delivery over the next few quarters. We expect to see some stability in this market in 2012. 
One possible explanation for the preference for Single-Tenant properties might be that - in these times of economic uncertainty - the strength of having a secure covenant on a long-term lease is probably viewed more favorably than having a collection of management intensive local businesses. It will be interesting to observe if this trend continues in to next quarter.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/15.png"></a>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial continue to exhibit either stability or compression in rates across nearly all markets from the previous quarter. Rates at the upper end (8.5% to 8.8%) are observed in Montreal, Quebec City, and Halifax. In terms of IRRs, the range appears to have narrowed a bit further this quarter in most markets, including Montreal and Quebec City.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/16.png"></a>
Face rate growth for the next 12 months for Single-Tenant Industrials are the highest in Edmonton, Toronto, and Ottawa (5%), even though the optimism level varies considerably in these markets given the wider bandwidth observed in the chart on the right. In all other regions, inflationary growth is anticipated in next 12 months (2.0% to 3.0%) and the respondents seem be agree. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=13&amp;market_1=2&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=118"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/17.png"></a>
In terms of historical valuation parameters for Single-Tenant Industrials in Edmonton, the chart on the right suggests that rates of return have steadily decreased over the past few years, and has now reached the level last obtained at the peak of the market boom in 2007 (7.7%)! 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. This product continues to retain its second position on the product preference barometer.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/18.png"></a>
In terms of location, Ottawa seems to be the most preferred location followed by Halifax and Toronto as indicated in the accompanying chart. Although the Calgary ratio is at zero, it simply means that this market is at equilibrium (i.e. equal number of buyers and sellers). Furthermore, Calgary has historically been a strong home owners market (70%, the highest rate in Canada), thus the market for multiple unit residential is relatively small in comparison to other major centres. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=118&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q3/19.png"></a>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 4.0% in Vancouver to a high of 7.0% in Halifax. One interesting pattern is that of IRR trends. The chart on the right shows a relatively large bandwidth for the IRR yields, notwithstanding relatively stable or declining averages. This suggests that investors remain slightly uncertain with overall risk for this asset and this further can be attributed to this asset being more highly leveraged and thus more prone to interest rate hikes and also to the wide range of this product in terms of quality and income potential. The low OCRs can be attributed to the fact that this asset class remained a sought after group throughout the recession and was subject to less yield decompression. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q3 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market continues to rebound to normalcy, though at a gradual and steady pace. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due in large part to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, "normal" means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability of quality product, deep pools of equity and active bidding for choice assets that occasionally become available. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey reveals some interesting trends this quarter. Ottawa has returned back to top preferred spot, possibly due to reduced concerns about potential budget cuts that would affect employment in the area. Overall, nearly all major centers included in the survey saw an upward momentum ratio trend. In terms of OCR and IRRs, the rates have remained relatively stable since last quarter, although Multiple Unit Residential saw some declines, as the demand for this product continues to rise. In terms of Property Type preference, Retail has returned back to top preferred spot this quarter and within the Industrial asset class, Single-Tenant Industrials appeared to be flavor of the quarter. There is also preliminary indication that Suburban Office buildings are gaining ground on the barometer, as foreign companies seek to establish a footprint in Canada. Suburban office provides an affordable option for them. Multiple Unit Residential also continues to be among the top favorites across nearly all locations.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
It remains to be seen if this growth can continue or will stabilize in upcoming quarters given the ongoing dismal news of poor economic performance in USA and Europe, and its anticipated consequences in the Canadian market. On a positive note, given Canada's strong economic engine in comparison to global markets, there is a possibility of more foreign funds investing in our market that would lead to further compression on rates. Stay tuned for this update in our annual year-end survey next quarter.
