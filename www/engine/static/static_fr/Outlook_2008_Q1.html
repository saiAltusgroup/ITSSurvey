<h2>Q1 2008 Outlook</h2>

<p>The survey provides a valuable insight into the trends in the Canadian commercial property market, which has been repositioning, following a 6 year upbeat bull market, which peaked in Spring 2007. During the last nine months, the <em>Investment Trends Survey</em> results have reflected a range of attitudes from caution and uncertainty to hints of confidence, as the market grappled with the impact of the deepening crisis in the United States and its impact on global financial markets. Unlike the financial markets, changes in real estate tend to be more subtle and the market players do not move in unison. As more information becomes available, participants have greater opportunity to weigh risk and respond, but the market remains imperfect. What is clear is that despite signs of growing economic weakness in Eastern Canada and sustained gloom from the United States, that the Canadian market is demonstrating surprising resilience and sustained demand for top quality assets. At the other end of the buyer scale, the appetite for secondary assets and markets has weakened, in lockstep with a more challenging debt environment.</p>

<p>The preference of property type during the last quarter has reflected a flight to traditionally sough after asset types. There is no doubt  that decreased availability of financing, higher debt service coverage ratios and more stringent credit requirements has had a negative impact on most property classes. This survey reported a modest recovery in attitude, with the top ten property types on the barometer recording an average of 3.25 bulls (buyers) for every seller (bears). This is a significant improvement to the 2.3 bulls to every bear reported in the Q4 2007 survey.</p>

<p>In terms of location preferences, Vancouver and Edmonton assumed top spots in this survey, with Ottawa and Toronto slipping to number 3 and 4 respectively. This may partly be a reflection of growing concern with the Ontario economy. Likewise, Halifax slipped to last position and, in response to strengthening energy prices, Calgary ascended in popularity from its basement position in the previous survey.</p>

<p>On the positive side, both values and yield requirements have generally held firm.</p>

<h3>Property Preferences</h3>

<p>The market has demonstrated a soft recovery,  returning to the traditionally sought after asset classes of industrial, retail and Downtown Class AA and Suburban Class A office. As a result of this shift, multi-family apartments slipped from favour to the number ten position on the <em>Altus InSite Product Barometer</em>. While the early signs of this recovery were evident in our last survey, the return to retail and industrial as chosen asset classes is now profound. What has not changed is the market’s lack of appetite for REIT units, Suburban Class B office and community malls, which continue to receive negative sentiment.</p>

<h3>Office buildings</h3>

<p>The survey response to office provides a good helicopter view of the market as a whole, with robust demand for first class assets and weakening interest in secondary real estate. Overall, 26.6% of respondents project that office values will increase during the next 12 months, while 52% believe that values will remain stable. <strong>Downtown Class AA</strong> office ascended to number five on the product barometer, and scored positively in Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver. The strength of sentiment was expressed by 3.1 bull votes compared to 1.9 sellers to every buyer in Q4 2007. OCRs for <strong>Downtown Class AA</strong> office have held firm across the country, except in Quebec where required &ldquo;going in&rdquo; yields increased. Softening of interest rates produced a slight downward trend in IRRs, albeit by only 10 basis points. On the other hand, <strong>Suburban Class B</strong> office has attracted bearish sentiment, with OCRs being up by 10 to 20 basis points across the country compared to 12 months ago. However, with an increase in rents, overall values are up by $40 to $60 per sq ft in Western locations and Ottawa, and flat in Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. <strong>Suburban Class B</strong> office has been most heavily impacted by the tightening of the debt markets and the departure of conduit lending.</p>

<h3>Retail</h3>

<p>Our retail survey included <strong>Tier I Regional Malls</strong>, <strong>Power Centres</strong> and <strong>Food Anchored Retail Strips</strong>. In the last survey, despite strong rental growth and low vacancy, survey participants expressed a requirement for slightly higher yields for <strong>Tier I Regional Malls</strong> of up 10 to 20 bps for overall cap rates and 10 to 30 bps for IRRs. In this survey, respondents reported little change in yield requirements for OCRs or IRRs for the prime Tier I Malls. As always, there is limited trading activity in this sought after product, but it does provide an interesting gauge of market sentiment for first class product. For <strong>Food Anchored Retail Strips</strong>, the OCR requirements firmed in Western locations and Toronto by 1.0 to 2.0 basis points to the 6.2% to 6.4% range, but unlike office, limited shift was reported for IRRs. This aligns with 84% of respondents predicting that values of Food Anchored retail centres will remain unchanged on an overall basis during the next 12 months. The reports for <strong>Power Centres</strong> indicate that investors required higher OCRs and IRRs across the country, bringing the Q1 2008 yield parameters almost in line with those required 12 months ago. Retail properties have moved back into vogue, occupying 4 out of 8 of the top positions on the <em>Altus InSite Property Type Barometer</em> and Tier I Regional Malls occupying the number one spot.</p>

<h3>Industrial</h3>

<p><strong>Single</strong> and <strong>Multi Tenant Industrial</strong> properties were ranked fourth and second respectively on the property type barometer this quarter.  In the Ottawa, Edmonton, Toronto and Calgary markets, OCRs for <strong>Single Tenant Industrial</strong> have increased slightly, to the 6.3% to 6.7% range, with decreasing OCR requirements of 6.9% to 7.5% being indicated in the Montreal and Quebec City markets. IRR requirements were up slightly in four markets and down in Quebec City, while remaining stable in Toronto and Montreal. <strong>Multi Tenant Industrial</strong>, which was recently considered to be a stable port in a storm, is now viewed in a more negative light, with OCRs and IRR requirements creeping up marginally in the Western locations and Toronto, but remaining unchanged in Montreal and Halifax. Generally unit market values have increased in the West, remained the same in Toronto and Montreal and declined in Halifax. Only 22.5% of respondents believe that values will increase during the next 12 months, following a run up in rents for industrial during the last 2 years in most locations</p>

<h3>Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h3>

<p>Perceived challenges in the debt market and more challenging lending conditions appear to have impacted the desirability of multi-res investments. This asset class slipped from number four position to number ten in the property type barometer. However, it remains a highly favoured asset class, producing the lowest reported yields of any class and it’s recent repositioning may only be to make room for the more traditional retail and industrial assets. Required OCRs have moved upwards in this survey by 20 bps in Toronto to 6.2% and up 20 bps in Vancouver to 4.8%. However, in some cases respondents still appear to provide conservative answers, since actual transactions are more aggressive. Not surprisingly, unit prices have increased during the last 12 months in Western cities by $5,000 to $12,000 per unit and $7,000 per unit in Halifax. Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa report only marginal changes in year over year unit values.</p>
