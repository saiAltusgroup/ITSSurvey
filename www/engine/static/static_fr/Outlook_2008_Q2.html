<h2>Q2 2008 Outlook</h2>

<p>The Q2 2008 survey provides confirmation that the Canadian commercial property market, has finally, after 12 months of hesitancy, responded to the growing US and worldwide economic crisis. Finally, based on ITS responses, the Canadian commercial property bull market, which sustained for six years, is over. During the last three quarters, the ITS results demonstrated remarkable resilience, reflected in a range of attitudes from caution and uncertainty to hints of confidence. However, the Q2 2008 barometer readings and valuation parameters at last reflect a “sea change” in attitude. While sentiment is still slightly bullish, demand has weakened across the country and yield requirements have stiffened for all asset types. The market has fully re-priced itself to reflect risk and quality. In some markets, given weakening demand and lending constraints, some lower quality assets may be close to being illiquid. At the other end of the scale, prime assets are still in demand, but are attracting higher yield parameters and smaller pools of buyers. The seller’s side is characterized by a state of inertia - a time to sit tight and a reluctance to sell under current conditions.</p>

<p>In our last survey, we noted that the decreased availability of financing, higher debt service coverage ratios and more stringent credit requirements had reduced the demand for most property classes. In Q2 2008, the growing credit restraints appear to be augmented by an erosion in buyer confidence. This is demonstrated by the top ten property types on the barometer, recording an average of 2.09 bulls (buyers) for every bear (seller), compared to 3.25 bulls to every bear reported in the Q1 2008 survey. In terms of location preferences, Vancouver and Edmonton maintained the top spots in this survey for the third quarter running, reflecting a vote of confidence in the western resource economies. Interestingly, whilst the sentiment for Montreal remained low at 1.6 bull votes, the weakness in demand for other locations caused the city to ascend to the number 3 position, leapfrogging over Toronto and Ottawa. Economic weakness in Ontario is the main cause of both Ottawa and Toronto slipping in the standings. At the same time, Calgary, Quebec City and Halifax are edging towards the equilibrium point of a balanced market, at 1.1 to 1.2 buyers for every seller.</p>

<h3>Property Preferences</h3>

<p>The market’s top preferences continue to be for Single and Multi-Tenant Industrial assets. A surprising move into third position is Downtown Land with 2.3 buyers for every seller, representing the only asset class surveyed to demonstrate positive momentum. This is followed by the retail choices of Tier I Regional Malls, Food Anchored Retail Strip and Power Centers, but like industrial, these also reflect negative buyer momentum. Multi-Unit Residential remains in the number ten position, but with weaker momentum of only 1.5 buyers for every seller. What has not changed is the market’s lack of appetite for Downtown and Suburban Class “B” office, Hotels and Community Malls, all of which continue to receive negative sentiment.</p>

<h3>Office buildings</h3>

<p>The office survey provided a surprisingly strong response in favour of Downtown and Suburban Office land, particularly in Vancouver and Edmonton, but also in Quebec City, Ottawa and Montreal. This clearly reflects positioning for the next development cycle and growing investor caution about built assets. Downtown Class “AA” office slipped two places to number seven on the product barometer and, coupled with retail and industrial assets, demonstrated weakening buyer appetite. The strongest demand was evident in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Suburban Class “A” office slipped in popularity to 11th place with 1.6 buyers for every seller. Respondents expressed their weakening sentiment for Class “AA” office product by requiring higher “going in” yields, with overall cap rate requirements up by 10 bps to the 5.9% to 7.1% range. Vancouver, rated the most attractive office market, maintained the same IRR at 7.2%, but all other markets required higher IRRs in the 7.5% to 8.2% range. Interestingly, the required average Halifax IRR dropped to 8.1%. At the other end of the scale, Class ”B” Suburban office has been most heavily impacted by the bearish shift in demand, recording 1.3 sellers to every buyer.</p>

<h3>Retail</h3>

<p>Our retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Power Centers, Food Anchored Retail Strips and Community Malls. Respondents expressed a softening of market demand, not only in bearish momentum on the barometer for retail product, but also in higher yield requirements. In this survey, participants reported higher yield expectations for Tier I Malls, increasing 10 to 20 bps for overall cap rates and for IRRs. This contrasts to the Q1 2008 survey, in which respondents reported little change in yield requirements for OCRs or IRRs for the prime Tier I Retail Malls. As always, there is limited trading activity in this “sought after” product, but it does provide an insight in the shift of market sentiment. The “poor cousin” of our retail survey, the Community Mall, reported 2.2 sellers for every buyer and overall cap rates of 6.7 % in Vancouver up to 8.0 % in Halifax.</p>

<h3>Industrial</h3>

<p>Single and Multi-Tenant Industrial properties were ranked as the top two picks in the Property Type Barometer this quarter, despite bearish demand momentum and a requirement for increased yields. Not surprisingly, the fall in demand for industrial properties has been most pronounced in the eastern locations of Toronto, Ottawa and particularly Montreal and Quebec. In Calgary, the most desired market for industrial investors, the momentum ratio of buyers and sellers dropped from 21.0 in Q1 2008 to 9.0 for Single Tenant and from 18.0 to 5.3 buyers for every seller for Multi Tenant Industrial.. Demand was also down in the key western markets of Vancouver and Edmonton. OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial have increased by 10 to 30 basis points for all markets, except Calgary, which remained unchanged at 6.3%. Vancouver was up to 6.2% and Halifax up to 7.4%. IRRs for Single Tenant Industrial followed a similar upward pattern to the 7.5% to 9.0 % range. In terms of Multi-Tenant Industrial, the “going in” yield requirement were up in all locations by 10 to 20 basis points, except Edmonton and Quebec City, which remained stable at 6.6% and 7.8% respectively. IRR requirements were up slightly in five markets and down in Halifax, while remaining stable in Vancouver. Finally, while greater demand is reported for Multi Tenant Industrial properties, investors continue to require slightly higher yields compared to single tenant product.</p>

<h3>Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h3>

<p>This asset class has slipped from number four position to number ten in the Property Type Barometer during the last 6 months. Concurrently, the level of demand has slipped from 6.3 buyers for every seller in Q3 2007 to 1.6 buyers in the latest survey. This partly reflects the growing challenges in the lending market, or higher debt service coverage ratios, lower loan to value ratios and a general lack of availability. Required OCRs have moved upwards in this survey by 10 to 20 bps, but moved down slightly in Montreal and Ottawa. The lowest overall cap rates are reported in the west, in the 5.2% to 5.7% range, with eastern locations reporting higher rates of 6.0% to 7.0%. The highest demand for Multi-Unit Residential in the country is in Ottawa, with 4.0 buyers to every seller, followed closely by Toronto and Montreal. The balance of the country is generally reporting negative momentum. Vancouver continues to report the highest prices per unit at $175,975, followed by Calgary at $157,200.alifax has the lowest unit prices at $88,833, followed closely by Toron The greatest challenge in reporting this asset class is the lack of trading activity, country-wide, upon which to base accurate benchmarks.</p>
