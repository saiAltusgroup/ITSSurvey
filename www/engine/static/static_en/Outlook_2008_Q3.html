Given the year-long, global financial market turmoil there is definitely a chill in the air of commercial real estate markets across Canada although investment sentiment reflects relative stability of prices and yields for Class A office, retail, industrial and multi-family assets. Our Q3 2008 Survey results still point to a higher proportion of investors who are bullish compared to those who are bearish, <em><strong>however it is important to note that the 110 respondents to the Altus survey were questioned in August 2008 prior to the carnage taking place at the time of this writing early October</strong></em>. The Location Barometer shown on the right illustrates the bullish demand for office investment with the exception of Calgary and Edmonton. It seems that investors are taking a positive longer-term view despite the financial markets turmoil.</p>

<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H100&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/02.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
The Investor Outlook graph on the right shows Investor Outlook indicating a declining bullishness. Note a decline in the number who forecast a price increase (green), a rising number who believe that a decrease (red) is on the way and greater proportion (orange) who forecast no change. As evidence of the trend, brokers observe that market caution now results in much longer marketing periods to secure transactions.</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h3>
<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H203&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/15.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
The national view of real estate investment yields across all major high quality classes remains stable and belies the caution expressed in investor outlook. Typical is the Development Yields graph at the right showing the yields for Montreal Downtown A office investment and this illustrates the strong yield decline since 2000 and rising values per square foot.</p>

<p>Respondents indicate that yields are not increasing dramatically for good assets and price is not declining, despite investors’ view that debt costs are set to increase and liquidity continues to be an issue. At right is a graph of OCR yields comparing different classes and is intriguing. The graph shows the lower yields for the major markets of Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. Surprising are the higher yields expected in Montreal.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S305&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/04.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
The lowest yields across the country are reserved for multi-res and in particular Vancouver where 4.5% is still an acceptable cap rate. Given their limited availability at any time, Regional Malls remain a desired investment cap rates as low as 5% in Toronto is openly acknowledged. Typical AA Montreal office can be measured at 6% compared to Vancouver at 5.25%.</p>

<p>Other property types such as Class B office, community retail, industrial suburban land and downtown land for office have a distinctly more bearish demand although again the Altus survey does not yet register a heavily negative market in terms of yield. However this is an area of the market where price will likely be impacted in the future by the bearish demand and the higher forecast debt costs and far less availability of debt. The sell side is characterized by a state of inertia – few owners are over-levered, cash flow remains strong and the bid/ask gap is simply too wide to sell under weaker conditions. We are unlikely to see materially falling prices until vendors are forced to sell.</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Office Investment</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H500&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=4&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/05.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
The vacancy outlook is clearly a major feature of this investment class and the current survey results show that the investors view of the near term future for vacancy is starting to look a little more negative. Looking at the historical charts Toronto, for example, shows the greatest sign of growing negativity in the downtown AA market in 5 years – a not unexpected result given the nearing completion of a significant amount of new supply. Other Class B markets are much more significantly negative as in the Office Vacancy Barometer graph on the right shows for Calgary downtown B office.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R200&amp;period=106&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=5&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/07.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
Investors’ perception of current net effective rate growth is surprisingly higher for suburban A buildings is shown in the graph on the right. Calgary and Vancouver are leading the way although still well behind economic face rates – more than $6 behind in Calgary. This is an indicator of the lack of incentive to build but nonetheless a strangely positive outlook across the country.</p>

<p>The outlook for rental rates is still a modest rise near and long term. However, development yields to motivate new buildings on the other hand are rising.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=106&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=5&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/08.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
Yields are a constant part of the Investment Trends Survey and we can see a generally flattening trend that differs from the decline which occurred over the past 8 years. The Valuation Parameters graph at right shows that Suburban Office building yields are increasing but are still low. For example, in the current survey results Vancouver shows a 6.0% OCR and 7.5% IRR. By contrast, the actual transaction of Crestwood Corporate Centre in Richmond at over $200 Million closed in August 2008 at a 5.28% OCR and an IRR of 7.13%.</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Retail</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=9&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/09.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
Investment in retail property is still in high demand with bulls outstripping bears by as much as 3:1, although limited to Food Anchored, Power Centre and Regional Centres. This is in the face of an obviously downward trend of consumer confidence and potentially to retail sales overall. Reflecting the caution, and of significance, is the now stable trend of cap rates and internal rates. The yield compression trend that started in Q1 2000 has finally ended in this Q3 2008 quarter reflected in a “hockey stick” uptick evident in the graph on the right.</p>

<p>The uptick is small, perhaps a 25 bps rise for a good quality assets but the first indication of caution, even in the most secure of property investment classes.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=106&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=9&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/10.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
Across the country it seems that the most sought after market is Vancouver (see parameters graph on the right) since yields are the lowest at less than 6% using the bottom end of the range for Food Anchored retail strip malls. The same investment in Halifax yields 7%, again using the lowest end of the range in this still bullish demand market. Internal Rates of Return are rising but are still low at 8% in the major markets compared to the historical benchmark spread of long-term bond yields.</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H402&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/11.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
We have surveyed industrial demand cycles quarterly for 8 years and this has consistently been the most bullish property investment type ranging from 2:1 bulls to bears up to 23:1. The results for this quarter shown in the Property Type Barometer on the right indicate still another bullish sentiment of 3.6 in the face of difficult economic news, in particular for Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<p>The chill is registered in the Location Barometer where Single and Multi-Tenant Industrial investments have slipped from their top ranking versus other property types. There is also a significant fall into bearish territory for industrial land (see graph at right) indicating the more speculative part of the market but where previously an almost universal bullishness was registered since the year 2000. The chart below shows Vancouver but a similar picture is reflected in other parts of the country.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H401&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=14&amp;market_1=1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/12.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
Investment yields in terms of cap rates and internal rates have definitely flattened out and have started a gradual rise since Q2 2007. For example, the cap rate for a prime Toronto single tenant investment is now 6.5% compared to 6% in 2007. Clearly there is some caution and although cap rates are not much higher, certainly the 8-year compression trend of yields has ended.</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S200&amp;period=106&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" src="static_en/image/2008_Q3/13.gif" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart"></a>
This is typically the most stable of property investment types and in some respects is counter cyclical since rental housing is a stable economic need, displaying low vacancy in weaker markets. Across the country there has been a constant over abundance of bullish sentiment coupled with the lowest yields of all investment types. Preferred locations are Toronto Calgary and Ottawa. Cap rates are still very low but rates even in this multi-res market have flattened out since Q3 2007. Nonetheless cap rates are low, for example a typical Toronto multi-res. benchmark is expected to range between 6% and 7.25%.</p>

<p>The largest threat to this investment type is energy costs (see graph on right) as more than two-thirds of those surveyed indicated this threat rather than any concern about new legislation, vacancy of even economic conditions.</p>

<p>Availability and cost of debt is less of a concern than other sectors since CMHC is still a reliable source.</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Summary</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">In summary, the chill in Canadian real estate marketplace is quite universal although not pronounced in the more stable investment types. The more speculative types such as Class B office, Tier II retail / Community Malls or land for development demonstrate quite weaker demand and have clearly been affected by the disappearance of CMBS debt providers and general liquidity concerns. Good quality, stable investments appear to have suffered only a slightly weaker demand and a roughly 25 to 50 basis point rise in cap rate and internal rate yields over the past 12 months but significant is that the 8-year yield compression has clearly ended.</p>
