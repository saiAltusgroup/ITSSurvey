The Canadian commercial property market continues to report weakening investment trends and at this stage of the economic cycle, all categories of assets are subject to downward pressure on prices. The improvement in the flow of credit from lending institutions has not translated into improved confidence in the real estate investment market and most qualified investors appear to be adopting a “wait and see” attitude. The Q1 2009 Investment Trends Survey reports increasing yield requirements for prime retail, industrial and office properties, as both vendors and purchasers search for the bottom of the market. For the second quarter, the Location Barometer indicates bearish demand (more sellers than buyers) in all Canadian locations except Ottawa. The nation’s capital, while not immune to the struggles associated with the waning US economy, is shielded by stable public administration employment and slightly positive GDP growth. Momentum indicators are extremely weak, with shallow demand (few buyers) and shallow supply (few sellers). In Ottawa the location barometer indicated one buyer for every seller and in Calgary, at number seven position, the barometer indicates there are 1.9 sellers for every buyer. Eastern cities of Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax are slightly bearish but stable. Calgary and Edmonton are least favoured, in response to low energy prices, rising unemployment and unusually weak GDP projections for 2009.

The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Vancouver Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on property price trends for first class assets. In our Q1 2008 survey, only 7.4% of respondents were of the opinion that Vancouver Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 45.8% voted for an increase. Since this survey 12 months ago, the economic downturn in the USA and Europe has deepened and Canada’s economy has slumped, particularly the manufacturing sector in the East and the energy industry in the West. In the current survey, 71% of respondents (red) indicated that Vancouver Class AA Office values would decrease during the next 12 months, only 4.2% believe that they will increase (green) and 25% forecast no change (orange). The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally was Suburban Multiple Unit Residential and even then, the Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 66% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 28% predicted that prices would decrease during the next 12 months.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h3>

During the last two quarters, investors in the Canadian commercial property investment market have reacted to negative economic conditions by requiring higher yields for all asset types. Respondents indicate that yield requirements continue to increase across the board, as investors respond to the shortage of credit, anticipated weaker demand, increased vacancy and softening rents. At the right is a graph of OCR yields compares different classes of assets in locations across Canada. Not surprisingly, the lowest yields and highest prices are reported for all product types in Vancouver and the highest yields in terms of OCR’s are reported in the smaller centres of Quebec City and Halifax. Calgary and Edmonton are showing weakening demand in response to the protracted energy sector meltdown. These previously favoured Alberta cities are now viewed as being comparable to Toronto and Ottawa in terms of required yields. The lowest “Going In“ yields predominate in the Suburban Multi Residential sector in the 5.7% to 7.5% range. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
In terms of IRRs our respondents continue to report “decompression” in IRR’s for prime properties, reflecting a high degree of investor uncertainty and lack of confidence. In this survey, the yield requirements for good quality assets increased less dramatically than the “jump shift” experienced in the previous survey. The lowest yields are reported in respect of Suburban Multi Residential, with significant increases being shown by Single Tenant Industrial, with IRRs of 8.1% to 9.5%.
</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R402&amp;period=108&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/06.gif"></a>
The market’s top preference is for Suburban Multi Unit Residential, as illustrated by the graph to the right, with 3.9 buyers for every seller. This is not surprising, given the difficulties being experienced in the single family market and the current attraction for rental accommodation. The Q1 Property Type Barometer is showing slightly more bullish signs for specific asset types. For example, Multiple Unit Residential improved from only 1.2 buyers per seller to 3.9 buyers; Tier 1 Regional Malls increased from 1.6 buyers to 3.2 buyers during the last 3 months. The top pick last quarter, Food Anchored Retail Strips, improved slightly from 2.3 buyers to 2.9 buyers. This may well be in response to the anticipation of more attractive pricing and increased yields for these sought-after property types. On the other end of the demand scale, Suburban Class “B” Office slipped dramatically from 3.1 to 9.1 sellers for every buyer. Hotels and Community Malls are also least preferred and report 4.8 and 4.4 sellers to every buyer, respectively. With the development market having cycled out and with tight credit, land in all categories remains in bearish territory on the Product Barometer in Q1 2009.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R404&amp;period=108&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3,4,1,5,6,2&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/08.gif"></a>

The office vacancy outlook is a major feature of this investment class and the respondent’s view of during the next three months is pessimistic. The momentum outlook for vacancy is negative for all markets, including downtown Halifax. The Toronto, Edmonton and Montreal markets appear to attract the most negative responses. The response for Calgary Downtown office sector was less negative, because it remains relatively undersupplied, until major office completions later this year. The government cities of Quebec City and Ottawa appear to attract more positive, albeit still bearish, vacancy predictions.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Barometer for office investments indicates the current lack of market confidence in all office types, but particularly suburban land and buildings. The office sector is particularly impacted by weakening demand, cutbacks in tenant expansion plans and increasing sublet vacancies. As the economy slumped and investor appetite weakened, only Downtown Class AA Office attracts positive demand, albeit with only 1.3 buyers for every seller.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=108&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=20&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/10.gif"></a>

The Valuation Parameters for Downtown Class AA Office have softened during the last 12 months with OCR requirements increasing consistently across the country by 80 to 120 bps. Class AA Office was one of the last asset types to decompress, with a negative 30 to 50 bps shift during the last quarter alone. This results in current OCR’s in the range of 6.7% to 7.9%. The lack of recent market evidence makes confident prediction particularly difficult for our respondents at this point in this down cycle. In terms of IRRs, investor requirements have increased by 70 to 110 bps during the last 12 months, to the current range of 8.1% to 9.1%. The core markets of Calgary, Toronto and Montreal report a surprisingly tight range of 8.3% to 8.7%.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 survey includes Leasehold Valuation Parameters for Class AA Office. Compared to 12 months ago, OCR’s required are up by 80 to 130 bps in the 7.2% to 8.2% range. As market demand softens, so does the perception of risk by investors, which explains the required spread of 30 to 70 bps between freehold and leasehold OCR’s reported in this survey.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Retail</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=108&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=7&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/12.gif"></a>

Our Q1 retail survey included Tier I Malls, Power Centres and Food Anchored Retail Strips. Respondents continue to report a correction in the retail investment market, expressed in terms of a bearish shift on the barometer and also in much higher yield requirements. The graph on the right highlights the gradually declining fortunes of Power Centres. The combination of financing challenges, a higher perception of risk and soft consumer spending patterns resulted in Power Centres slipping into negative territory for the first time since 2002, with 1.4 sellers for every buyer in Q1 2009.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S101&amp;period=108&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/13.gif"></a>
The market downturn is highlighted by the shift in yield expectations for Tier I Malls, illustrated on the graph opposite. In the stronger western cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver, OCR yields increased to the 6.4% to 6.8% range, while in the more distressed eastern markets, yields shifted to 6.5% to 6.9%. The OCR yield requirements for Power Centres increased by 100 to 120 bps during the last 12 months in the tight 7.2% to 8.0% range. In comparison the yield rate decompression for Food Anchored Retail Strips is more varied, with increases in a wide range of 60 to 120 bps. The range of reported OCR’s indicates a wider range of 7.3% to 8.5%, with lower yield requirements in the western cities.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The chart opposite records respondent opinion on Motivation for Retail Investment. The key motivation is stability of income, but surprisingly, debt costs and potential loan to value ratio are a close second and third reason for retail investment.
</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H400&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=108&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/14.gif"></a>
Single and Multi Tenant Industrial properties were top performers during the previous five year bull market run. However, as the market decompresses, parameters for industrial assets are returning to more traditional norms. In terms of demand, the graph for Toronto multi-tenant industrial indicates 1.5 buyers for every seller and, whilst remaining positive, represents the least favourable measure in 9 years of the ITS survey. It also demonstrates slippage in demand from 5.8 buyers for every seller reported 12 months ago. The impact of higher vacancy, plant closures and reduced shipping requirements during tougher economic times is beginning to be reflected in increased yield requirements. Industrial investments remain in positive territory on the Property Barometer, but demand has fallen to 1.0 buyer for every seller for Single Tenant properties. The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant industrial across Canada. The required OCR’s have increased on average by 125 bps during the last year, but surprisingly, by only 45 bps this quarter. OCR’s for Single Tenant Industrial range from 7.1% to 8.4%, with higher values and lower yield requirements in Western Canada. The reported yields for Multi Tenant Industrial indicate a slightly higher range of 7.3% to 8.6%, an increase of 100 to 140 bps compared to 12 months ago.
</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Suburban Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=108&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q1/15.gif"></a>
This asset class remains the most stable property investment type and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Additionally, Multi Residential commands top position on the Property Type Barometer at 3.9 buyers per seller, a slight improvement from the previous quarter results. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential exhibits low vacancies and strong cash flow, supported by positive demographics and a sticky home ownership market. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation “Y” cohort. The challenge with this asset type is the ability to attract financing and the current stiffer lending ratios in place.
</p>

<p>
Multiple Residential has not been entirely immune from increased yield requirements experienced by other investment types. The graph on the right summarizes the Q1 valuation parameters for Multi Residential. Yield requirements have increased by between 10 bps (Montreal and Calgary) and 60 bps (Edmonton) during the last 3 months. The highest unit prices ($141,250 per unit) and lowest yields (5.7% OCR) are evidenced in Vancouver, and the lowest benchmark is set in Halifax at $89,562 per unit and 7.5% OCR. Multi Residential is predicted to sustain its top ranking, due to the lack of availability and the wide gap between buyer and seller expectations.
</p>


<h3 style="clear:both;">Summary</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
In summary, the Canadian commercial property market continues to explore where it is positioned in the downward cycle. At this stage, all categories of assets are subject to downward pressure on prices. The improvement in the flow of credit from lending institutions has not yet translated into improvement in confidence in the real estate investment market. Buyers are very selective about what they bid on and, while vendors have adjusted their expectations, the buyer/seller price gap remains, only at a different level. This is reflected in the wide value ranges expressed by survey respondents, who face the difficult task of being predictive in the face of thin market evidence.
