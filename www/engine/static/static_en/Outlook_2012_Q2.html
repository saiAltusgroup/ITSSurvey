<h2>Q2 2012 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2012 Investment Trends Survey indicates that the recent bull cycle in the Canadian commercial property market has cooled off slightly after the initial run in Q1 2012. While the Canadian market continues to benefit from the historically low interest rate environment, a shortage of supply in certain sectors, and an imposed discipline in the commercial development sector, the industry appears to be taking a cautionary stance in midst of global events, such as the European sovereign debt crisis, the softening economic outlook in Asia and the continued slow recovery of the US economy.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey reports continued compression in yield expectations, increasing rents and a run up in values, but yields have not yet compressed to the point of causing investor discomfort and lack confidence.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The market has seen several notable transactions in this quarter. However the general sentiment among owners and investors, especially among large institutional funds, is that of "cautious growth" outlook. In terms of market rental rate and compression in investment rate of returns, it appears that projected growth assumptions have scaled down from those in the previous quarter.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The European crisis lingers with Greece and Spain in severe economic crisis that led to the TSX downward slide this quarter and that also resulted in oil prices hovering around $80. Another concern, particularly in the resource sector, pertains to the oversupply of natural gas in the market that has kept prices at an all-time low. On the positive side, the US economic downturn is showing signs of bottoming out, as suggested in recent news that unemployment claims have decreased.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The one significant factor that could stall the current cycle is interest rates. The Bank of Canada has expressed concern about the level of consumer household debt and is signaling the possibility of an increase in interest rates, which would temper investor yield expectations and depress capital values.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Location Barometer</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/01.gif"></a>
The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of the eight cities surveyed in Canada as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investors rating of each city by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example, in Calgary, the most favoured centre for the last 3 quarters, the responses indicated an average of 2.6 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. Overall the ranking of the cities has not changed much since the previous quarter, with western provinces leading the top preferred locations. Calgary, fuelled by a buoyant energy sector with an abundant appetite for new downtown office product, has ranked in the top three investment locations on the Location Barometer during the last 12 months. Edmonton, benefitting from the strong Alberta economy and positive GDP projections by the Conference Board of Canada, has moved up to second place from number four position two quarters ago. Vancouver, traditionally a popular choice, remains in number three position in this survey. One notable change in this survey is that overall the movement in all locations has either remained steady or trended downwards from the previous quarter.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investor Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/02.gif"></a>
The Investor Outlook charts the attitude of respondents to the strength of the future market, expressed as opinion of value trend. For example, for Downtown Class "AA" Office, which has been one of the most favoured products in the past two quarters, the majority of the respondents indicate no change in market valuation parameters over the next 12 months. This cautious outlook is consistent with the overall restrained investor sentiment in the market this past quarter.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=121"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/04.gif"></a>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=121"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/03.gif"></a>
This graph compares OCRs for different types of assets in the hub cities across Canada. The Q2 2012 results clearly demonstrate stability with 47% of product/locations showing "SAME" (stability) and rest indicating lower OCRs (compression). The greatest compression, quarter over quarter, in the order of 10 to 30 bps was in respect of Class "AA" office and Tier I Regional Mall. More significant is that for a number of products and locations, OCRs are now lower than those reported in the last market peak in Q2 2007. This is a clear signal that the current market cycle has yet to bottom out and that yields continue to compress, primarily due to the historically low interest rate environment.
</p>

<p>
In terms of IRRs, our respondents are equally cautious, with previous quarter results indicating significant IRR compression, while current quarter rates suggest stability. Only 6% of respondents thought that IRRs had increased, 60% consider them to be the same and the rest believe that IRRs have decreased. The overall impression one is left with, is that investors are now taking a cautious stance with rates and lofty growth projections are no longer the norm.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/05.gif"></a>
There has been a significant repositioning of property preference in Q2 2012. Tier I Regional Mall and Food Anchored Retail Strip have replaced Multi-Tenant and Single Tenant Industrial options as the number one and two choices, with 5.3 and 4.5 buyers for every seller, respectively. Multi-Tenant Industrial (3.9 buyers for every seller) and Single Tenant Industrial (2.9) have slipped back once again to number 3 and 4 positions, while Downtown Class "AA" Office has moved down to sixth position. Interestingly, Downtown Office Land maintained a top ten position, underscoring a new office construction cycle in many locations. The shift back to retail products is indication of a cautionary stance being taken once again by investors who are moving back to 'safe' assets, as retail survived the recent crash very well and historically has been a strong fallback option. While a correction is not anticipated, as evidenced in the continued preference for industrial products, there seems to be less optimism as witnessed in Q1 2012. As the cycle strengthens, only 2 products, namely Hotel and Suburban Class "B" Office remain in negative position, as indicated by an excess of sellers over buyers.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/06.gif"></a>
The Office sector has rebounded in popularity during the last 21 months, but the Q2 2012 Office Vacancy Barometer, a forecast of office vacancy trends, indicates some signs of retrenchment. Weaker results are indicated for all locations except for Downtown and Suburban Calgary, which have seen a dramatic drop in vacancy as a result of increased employment activity in the Oil and Gas sector. Most caution is expressed for the office sector in Ottawa, where Downtown and Suburban office vacancy is projected to increase over the next three months. Vacancy is also expected to increase in Suburban Class "B" Office in Vancouver and Halifax. The most significant observation is that for nearly all locations and office classes, the outlook is in a decline of vacancy.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/07.gif"></a>
The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite. The OCRs for Class AA Office now range from 5.3% in Vancouver to 6.7% in Halifax. In all locations, OCRs now equal or surpass those reported at the height of the last cycle in Q2 2007. For example, in Vancouver, the OCR last peaked in Q2 2007 at 5.7% and currently sits at 5.3%, a full 40 bps lower.
</p>

<p>
The same results are indicated for Downtown Class AA Office IRRs, which sit from 10 bps (Halifax) to 60 bps lower (Vancouver and Montreal) than the 2007 market peak yields. This can partially be explained by the fact that 10 year Government of Canada Bonds is currently yielding around 2.0% versus about 4.0% in 2007.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R201&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/09.gif"></a>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=23"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/08.gif"></a>
The investment parameters for Downtown Class "AA" Office Leasehold are illustrated on the slide opposite. The OCRs range from 5.7% to 7.1%, a discount of 30 to 40 bps over the "freehold" Downtown AA investments. The spread basically reflects the discount required for lack of reversion, land lease payments and less liquidity for a leasehold investment.
</p>

<p>
The Q2 2012 survey also addresses Market Face Rates for Downtown Class "A" Office. The highest face rates are reported in Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto at $45.00 per sq. ft., which fall short of the face rates achieved during the 2007 market peak. The lowest rates are in Quebec, with Quebec City at under $17.00 per sq. ft.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/11.gif"></a>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/10.gif"></a>
The preceding chart shows Calgary Vancouver and Edmonton as top location preferences for retail properties. Given the robust economy in Western Canada, it is hardly surprising to see this result. Laggards continue to be the Eastern Canada centres of Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax.
</p>

<p>
Tier I Regional Mall and Food Anchored Retail Strip products are in the top two positions in terms of product preference as indicated in the accompanying chart. In both cases, positive momentum is observed given the historical preference for these products during the preceding recessionary cycles. These products are considered 'safer' assets given the consumer oriented nature of the tenancies that tend to be inelastic to vagrancies of the economy.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/12.gif"></a>
OCRs range from 4.5% to 7% for Tier 1 Regional Mall across the nation with lowest rates indicated in Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto, the three largest markets for this product. Similarly IRR rates range from just below 6% in Vancouver to 8% in Quebec City. Overall, the momentum in rates is stable given the prior existing strong demand for retail. The change essentially in this quarter is that investor preference is moving back to retail products as they might be less optimistic about the other alternatives such as Industrial and Office.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=14,12,13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/13.gif"></a>
Industrial properties continue to remain strong overall, but an obvious change in this quarter survey indicates a declining momentum ratio for the product in most markets, once again confirming the overall sentiment to slow down from earlier frenzy for industrial products. Edmonton and Calgary remain the top markets for location preference for obvious reasons, given the resurgence of oil sands activity.
</p>

<p>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs and IRRs for Multi-Tenant Industrial appear to be on a downward shift for the large part across most markets. The spread in the two rates is generally around 100 basis points suggesting moderate growth and stabilization in this product.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;"><a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/15.gif"></a>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/14.gif"></a>
In terms of face rate forecasts the accompanying chart indicates a very positive upward trend in rates over the next 12 months and beyond in all markets. Calgary and Edmonton markets expect the largest percentage in growth rate in next 12 months averaging 2.5% increase, not surprising given the strong positive correlation of this product with the oil sands activity, longer term growth projection are more modest, suggesting similar growth projections for most major markets across the country.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. This product continues to retain its top ten position on the product preference barometer; although it has receded to the bottom as higher yielding investment products have taken front seat over the past three quarters with gradual economic recovery in the country.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/17.gif"></a>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=121&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q2/16.gif"></a>
In terms of location, Calgary and Edmonton have now topped the list this quarter as most preferred locations, once again indicative of the increase in oil sands activity and accompanying job growth in the Province. All other markets remain steady in terms of momentum ratio. Vancouver is the exception as there seems to be more sellers than buyers.
</p>

<p>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 4% in Vancouver to a high of 6.5% in Halifax. The low OCRs can be attributed to the fact that this asset class remained a "sought after" group and vacancy has been declining nationwide.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2012 Investment Trends Survey indicates a slowdown from the bullish outlook in the previous quarter across most product types and locations. Reasons for this can possibly be attributed to the low prices of natural gas and oil prices in world markets that could dampen economic productivity in Alberta and other western provinces, slow recovery of the US economy and ongoing concerns about the Euro financial crisis.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Canadian market continues to benefit from low interest rates, a shortage of supply in certain sectors and an imposed discipline in the commercial development sector. The Investment Trends Survey reports a continued compression in yields, increasing rents and a run up in values, albeit at a more modest pace than in the previous quarter.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The risk of increase in interest rates always remains as an overall market threat. The Bank of Canada has expressed concern about the level of consumer household debt and indeed has taken precautionary measures by increasing the minimum down payment on household mortgages to 20% and capped the CMCH insurance limit. Talks of potential increases in interest rates continue, though no action in this regard has yet been taken. Generally the sentiment appears to be cautiously positive.
</p>
