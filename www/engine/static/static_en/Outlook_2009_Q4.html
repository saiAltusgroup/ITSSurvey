<h2>Q4 2009 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q4 2009 Investment Trends Survey reports a slow journey to recovery in the Canadian commercial real estate market. Overall, the survey results reflect growing confidence in the retail and multi family sectors and a degree of caution in the office and industrial markets. The recovery curve is bumpy and uneven and shifts in both buyer and seller attitudes are very gradual, due partly to lack of liquidity and sticky availability and terms of financing.
</p>

<p>
The commercial real estate market is, not unexpectedly, experiencing a lagged recovery compared to other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock market and single family housing sector. On a bright note, REITs are making good progress in re-financing and raising capital and are beginning to re-emerge as buyers. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads is encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors on the sidelines. Unlike the USA, the Canadian market has not seen the same volume of distress opportunities at discounted prices, although the office sector in some locations may come under stress in the months ahead.
</p>

<p>
The "jobless recovery" in the economy appears to be impacting the office, industrial and to an extent retail sectors.

The Location Barometer on the right summarizes the relative attractiveness of eight cities across Canada, as investment locations.  This barometer measures the appeal of each city surveyed by comparing the number of buyers and sellers. For example in Ottawa, the 315 responses indicated 2 buyers for every seller as an average for all the property types surveyed. Whilst all locations except Calgary reported positive demand, the momentum was down in four cities, namely Ottawa, Toronto, Quebec City and Halifax. Momentum in the Montreal and Calgary markets remained flat and Vancouver and Edmonton indicated a mildly positive change in appetite. Compared to previous surveys, the responses are tepid at best, with the leading investment location Vancouver reporting 2.3 buyers for every seller. In the Q3 2009 survey, the top ranked city Ottawa reported 2.5 buyers for every seller. Calgary remains in negative territory with 1.2 sellers for every buyer. The Calgary economy is characterized by weak energy prices, delayed oil sands projects, pressure to mitigate environmental impacts of energy exploration, a growing glut of new office space and weak employment trends.

 The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Vancouver Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on trends for office assets. In our Q4 2008 survey, 58.1 % of respondents were of the opinion that Vancouver Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 6.5 % that prices would increase. In the current survey, attitudes are far more positive, with only 14.3 % of respondents (red) indicating that Vancouver Class AA Office values would decrease and 35.7 % were of the opinion that values would increase. The majority at 50% were of the opinion that values would remain stable. This contrasts starkly with the depressed Downtown Calgary market, where 50% of respondents predict that Class AA Office values will decline and 43.3% predict stability.

 The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally is Tier I Regional Malls. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 54.4 % of respondents forecast stability in prices and 33.3 % (up from 16 % in Q3) predict an increase during the next 12 months. The greatest caution in the Investor Outlook is expressed for Single Tenant Industrial with 32.5 % of respondents predicting that values will fall during the next 12 months.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Following a decline in market values during 2008 and early 2009, our respondents indicate continuing signs of a decline in yield requirements and a corresponding increase in values. The replies to the survey in Q4 2009 indicate that 86 % of respondents conclude that the required OCR and IRRs are the same or less compared to the last quarter. There are now stronger signs that the commercial market is catching up with other economic sectors and investors are becoming more bullish about investment yields.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">

The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. A growing pattern is a requirement for higher yields in the Alberta marketplace. There is also a great deal of uncertainty, expressed in very wide "band widths" of opinion of up to 300 bps spread
The lowest "going in" yields continue to predominate in the Multi Residential sector in the 5.3% to 7.0% range, this being 10 to 30 bps than 12months ago. The other real estate types surveyed have OCR requirements which are 20 to 80 bps higher than 12 months ago. Despite improving results, respondents are still expressing some caution, in that in 7 % of the product/location choices, OCR are indicated to increase.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">

In terms of IRRs our respondents appear to report stability or bottoming out for prime real estate. In this survey, only two out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required IRRs, a total of 17 respondents reported a decrease and 13,  or 41% reported no change since the last quarter's survey.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/06.gif"></a>
The appetite for most types of assets has declined markedly since the last survey. In the Q4 survey, as illustrated on the graph to the right. Negative momentum and softening demand trends are being reported for most asset types. For example, the market's top preference, Tier I Regional Malls, reports 6.5 buyers for every seller, down from 9.9 buyers in the previous survey. Is this an aberration or a correction for over-zealousness in the last survey? Food Anchored Retail, Multi-Tenant Industrial and Downtown Class "A" Office remain top picks. Noteworthy is the ascendance in popularity of Power Centres and Tier II Regional Malls and a slippage of Suburban Multiple Unit Residential and Single Tenant Industrial. Under the current climate, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Suburban Class "B" Office, Hotels and Suburban Office Land being reported as the least preferred assets. Community Malls, the least desired asset class on the Property Type Barometer for many years, has improved in the standings with 1.5 sellers for every buyer, compared to 2.3 sellers reported in the Q3 2009 survey.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/07.gif"></a>
The Office Vacancy Outlook influences investors' appetite for this property class and the respondent's report that office vacancy will increase in all categories during the next three months. While the vacancy outlook is negative for all markets, Ottawa, Quebec City and Halifax are reporting a positive shift in momentum (less increase than previously reported). The categories which attract the strongest negative sentiment are Edmonton and Calgary Downtown  Class "AA" and Class "B" product. The product that has attracted most negativity and appears to have the greatest exposure is Class "B" Office. In a flight to better quality space tenants are attracted to softening rents in Class "A" buildings, leaving vacant Class "B" space behind.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/08.gif"></a>
Surprisingly and despite rising vacancies, required OCR  for Downtown Class "AA" Office have softened slightly, but required IRRs have firmed up since the Q3 2009 survey. OCR are reported in the average range of 6.5% to 7.7% and IRRs are in the 8.0 % to 8.8% range. Noteworthy is the spread of opinions of 200 bps for OCR in Calgary and 220 bps for IRRs in Montreal. While yield requirements have stabilized, investors anticipate a continued erosion of value, resulting from decreasing rents and increased exposure to vacancy as well as credit loss
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/09.gif"></a>
Our Q4 retail survey included Tier I and Tier II Regional Malls and Community Malls. Respondents reported a stronger interest in the retail investment market, reflected in a lowering of yield expectations during the last 12 months. Tier I Regional Malls has retained number one position on the Property Barometer, with 6.5 buyers for every seller, down from 9.9 buyers in the last survey. In terms of expected yield rates, OCR currently range from 6.4% to 7.2% and IRRs from 7.7% to 8.4%. A recent sale of the 804,000 sq ft Sunridge Mall in Calgary for $251 million indicated an OCR in the range of 6.5% and IRR in the range of 7.5% to 7.75 %. Tier II Regional Malls are coming back into vogue, moving up from number 8 position to number 5 on the product barometer. Yield requirements are tending downwards with the lowest OCR of 7.2% to 7.8% being reported in the western provinces and slightly higher rates of 7.9% to 8.3% in central and eastern Canada. IRR expectations are also lower, in the 8.4% to 9.5% range.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=11&amp;market_1=11&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=111"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/10.gif"></a>
Community Malls have, after many years in the doldrums, improved in popularity and  have moved up on the product barometer. The current and reported yields for a typical Halifax Community Mall mirrors the national trend, as shown on the slide opposite. OCR declined steadily from Q2 2001, during the long bull market run and bottomed out at around 7.7% in Q2 2007. Yields then increased in response to soft demand to 8.9% in Q2 2009 and then, as appetite improved, dropped again to the current 8.5%. By contrast OCR for Community Malls in Vancouver are currently reported at 7.4%. Interestingly, OCR for Community Malls located in western Canada have increased by 10 to 20 bps during the last 12 months and have decreased in the east by 10 bps in Montreal and 30 bps in Toronto.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R132&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/11.gif"></a>
Industrial properties remains highly ranked asset choices, but are still prone to the impact of vacancy, plant closures and reduced shipping requirements during tougher economic times. As a result, respondents conclude that there is downward pressure on rental rates in the majority of centres surveyed. The highest typical 5 year rental face rates are in the Western locations, ranging from $7.29 psf to $7.61 psf . This likely reflects more modern industrial product, less exposure to plant closures and higher construction costs. The Eastern cities reflect a lower average range for Multi tenant buildings of $5.28 psf in Montreal to $6.41 psf in Ottawa.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/12.gif"></a>
The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCR for Single Tenant Industrial range from 7.0% (Vancouver) to 8.4% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations, which have been less prone to the meltdown in the key manufacturing sector. The Montreal OCR of 8.0 % is showing stability, having increased only marginally by 20 bps since Q4 2008. During the same 12 month period, the majority of locations experienced an increase in required OCR of 30 to 60 bps and a corresponding decline in value.
</p>
<p>
In terms of Outlook, 17.5% of respondents believe that Single Tenant Industrial values will increase during the next 12 months, versus 32.5% who forecast a decrease. 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=111&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/13.gif"></a>
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation "Y" cohort, produces stable vacancies and cash flows. This sector also benefits from low cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. The reported yield in terms of OCR range from a low of 5.4% in Vancouver to 7.0% in Halifax.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=4&amp;property_1=15&amp;market_1=5&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=111"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/14.gif"></a>This investment type is currently counter cyclical in that reported OCR are 10 to 30 bps lower than those reported in Q4 2008. The reporting of higher values for Multi Family is confirmed by unit rates generally being reported at $2,000 to $7,000 per suite higher than 12 months ago. This is a very positive step on the road to recovery after a difficult 24 months. Multi Residential has demonstrated remarkable stability in yield requirements during the last 36 months, as illustrated by the historical performance of the Ottawa market.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?step=2&amp;report_2=S102&amp;period=111"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q4/15.gif"></a>
Following on from the reports on improving Multi Residential yields and values, the graph on the right summarizes motivation for Multi Residential Investment. Not surprisingly, the top ranking is given to debt costs, to a large part facilitated by CMHC insured mortgages and by low mortgage interest rates. "Stability in value versus other asset types" is ranked second and this sentiment is underscored by the increase in Multi Residential values reported in the last segment. Stability of income is also ranked highly by respondents, with Multi Unit Residential being largely shielded from the challenges of growing vacancy in the Office and Single Tenant Industrial sectors.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q4 2009 Investment Trends Survey results indicate a bumpy recovery for the Canadian commercial investment real estate market. This survey conveys less optimism and more caution in terms of Outlook The choppy nature of the rebound is not unexpected given the lack of trading volume of commercial properties, compared to the more responsive residential market. The commercial real estate market is experiencing a definite lag in recovery compared to other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock market and single family housing. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads is encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors on the sidelines. The broad bandwidth of investment yield results underscores the gap between buyers and seller expectations and many qualified buyers continue to await potential distress opportunities.
