<h2>Q3 2009 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The results from the Investment Trends Survey for Q3 2009 reveal growing signs of a return to stability in the Canadian commercial real estate market, tempered by caution that cash flows and values may face further erosion by a correction in rents and vacancies. Overall, the survey results reflect a more positive attitude and growing confidence in real estate investments, following a significant compression in asset values since the bull market peak in mid 2007. The Q3 2009 Survey certainly reflects stabilization in the yield requirements for prime retail, office and multi family assets, and mixed signals for industrial real estate.
</p>

<p>
However, there is sentiment, particularly in the office and the industrial sector, that rents and vacancy have yet to adjust to the new economic environment and in some sectors, there remains potential for further declines in value. The commercial real estate market is experiencing a lagged recovery compared to other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock market and single family housing. On a bright note, REITs are reported to be making good progress in re-financing and raising capital and are beginning to re-emerge as buyers. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads is encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors on the sidelines. The wide range of results for each investment yield category underscores the gap between buyers and seller expectations and many qualified buyers continue to play a waiting game in a market that lacks both volume and velocity.

The Location Barometer on the right compares the relative attractiveness of eight cities surveyed across Canada. The current survey shows bullish demand in terms of more buyers than sellers, in all locations except Calgary and Edmonton. Ottawa is selected for the third consecutive quarter as the top investment choice, with 2.6 buyers for every seller, compared to the least favored choice of Edmonton with 1.4 sellers for every buyer. Calgary is slightly negative with 1.1 sellers for every buyer, but is showing positive momentum. The greatest improvement is Halifax, which moved from number 8 position to number 3 positions. Surprisingly, Vancouver slipped to 4th position and, with Toronto moving up to number 2, Ontario therefore dominates the top two positions.

The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Toronto Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on trends for office assets. In our Q2 2009 survey, 23.1 % of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 3.8 % increase. In the current survey, attitudes have become more bearish, with 42.4 % of respondents (red) indicating that Toronto Class AA Office values would decrease and only 9.1% were of the opinion that values would increase.

The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally was Tier I Regional Malls, and even then, the Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 63.8 % of respondents forecast stability in prices, 20.2 % predict that prices will decrease and 16% increase during the next 12 months. It is clear that although yields have stabilized, the majority of our respondents are of the opinion that values will be stable or continue to erode during the next 12 months. The greatest caution is expressed for Multi and Single Tenant Industrial with 45.1% and 43.1% of respondents respectively predicting that values will fall during the next 12 months.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Following a decline in market values during 2008 and early 2009, our respondents indicate signs of stability, expressed in terms of yield requirements. Replies to the survey in Q3 2009 indicate that 87.5 % of responses conclude that the required OCRs and IRRs are the same or less compared to the last quarter. There are now stronger signs that the commercial market is catching up with other economic sectors and is starting to reach a comfort level with prevailing yields.

A continuing pattern is that the lowest yields and highest prices are reported for Vancouver and the highest yields in terms of OCRs are reported in the smaller centres of Quebec City and Halifax. The lowest "going in" yields continue to predominate in the Multi Residential sector in the 5.5% to 7.1% range. Despite the positive results, respondents are still expressing some caution, in that in 12.5 % of the product/location choices, OCRs are indicated to increase.

In this survey, only four out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required IRRs, a total of 11 respondents reported a decrease and 17, or 53% reported no change since the last quarter.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R402&amp;period=110&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q3/06.gif"></a>
The appetite for all types of assets has improved markedly since the last survey. The market's top preferences are for Tier I Regional Malls as illustrated on the graph to the right, with 9.9 buyers for every seller, up from 4.5 buyers in the previous survey. Positive momentum and improving demand is being reported for other sought after asset types, such as Food Anchored Retail, Suburban Multiple Unit Residential, Multi-Tenant Industrial and Downtown Class "A" Office. However, under the current climate, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Hotels, Suburban Office Land and Community Malls being reported as the least preferred assets. Suburban Class "B" Office is the least desired asset class on the Property Type Barometer, with 3.5 sellers for every buyer, an improvement from 5.4 sellers reported in the Q2 2009 survey.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R500&amp;period=110&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q3/07.gif"></a>
The Office Vacancy Barometer influences investors' appetite for this property class and respondents report that office vacancy will increase in all categories during the next three months. While the vacancy outlook is negative for all markets, Ottawa, Quebec City and Halifax are reporting a positive shift in momentum (less increase than previously reported). The categories that attract the strongest negative sentiment are Edmonton and Calgary Downtown Class"AA" and Class "B" product and, surprisingly, Ottawa Class "B" office. The product that has attracted most negativity and appears to have the greatest exposure is Class "B" Office. In a flight to better quality space, tenants are attracted to softening rents in Class "A" buildings, leaving vacant Class "B" space behind.

Respondents expressed strong support for "growth in cash flow" or upside as being the major factor influencing an office investment decision. The second highest ranked factor was Initial Return, followed by anticipation of capital appreciation.

<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=110&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q3/09.gif"></a>The Valuation Parameters graph surprisingly indicates that, despite rising vacancies, required yields for Downtown Class "A" Office have largely stabilized. OCRs are reported in the average range of 6.5% to 7.8% and IRRs in the 7.7% to 8.6% range. Noteworthy is the spread of opinions of 175 bps for OCRs in Halifax and 210bps for IRRs in Calgary. While yield requirements have stabilized, investors anticipate a continued erosion of value, both through decreasing rents and increased exposure to vacancy and credit loss. Unit rates per sq ft range from $437.94 in Vancouver to $200.00 per sq ft in Quebec City, and down overall between 3% and 6% from Q2 2009.

The OCRs have increased to the 7.2 % to 8.5 % range, an increase of 70 to 150 bps from the last survey, 12 months ago... The most dramatic increases are in Toronto (120 bps) and Calgary (150 bps). The IRRs for Suburban Class "A" Office are in the range of 8.5 % to 9.2%. The lowest required yields of 7.2% OCR and 8.5% IRR are reported for the Vancouver market. Typical of office market investment yields is the 162,000 sq ft Phase I of Stampede Station, a new office project in Calgary, which closed in July 2009 at $70.5 million plus an income guarantee at around a 7.5% OCR.

Respondents reported the retail investment market has stabilized with a bullish shift reported on the barometer and a stabilization of yield requirements. In Toronto there are currently 14.5 buyers for every seller for a Tier I Regional Mall, compared to 1.8 buyers for every seller at the bottom of the market in Q4 2008. The graph on the right highlights the fortunes of Tier I Regional Malls. The market peaked in Q1 2007 at a 5.4% OCR and gradually climbed to 6.5 % in Q1 2009, a yield that has held stable for the last 3 quarters. On a positive note, nationally Tier I Regional Malls has retained number one position on the Property Barometer, with 9.9 buyers for every seller.

The current yield expectations are illustrated on the graph opposite. Currently, OCRs range from 7.3% to 7.7% in Western Canada and from 7.7% to 8.3% in Eastern Canada. For example, the 143,000 sq ft Armadale Square in Markham Ontario closed in August 2009 for $32.4 million or about 8.0% OCR.

In the Montreal market, yields peaked for Power Centres in Q1 2007 at 5.8% OCR and 7.2% IRR, climbing to 7.3% OCR and 8.8% IRR in the current survey. Investors for this product type in Montreal still appear to be searching for the bottom of a market, being hit by shrinking consumer spending.

As a result, respondents conclude that during the next 12 months net rental rates for Single Tenant Industrial will be flat or decrease slightly in all markets, except Quebec City. Greater optimism is expressed for longer term rental growth in the subsequent forecast periods.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R100&amp;period=110&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q3/15.gif"></a>The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant Industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial range from 7.2% (Vancouver) to 8.6% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations, which have been less prone to the meltdown in the key manufacturing sector. The Toronto OCR of 7.9% is showing signs of stability, having increased only 10 bps since Q2 2009. As an example, a 9 year old 302,000 sq ft single tenant building on Westwinds Drive in north east Calgary and leased to an excellent covenant, closed in August 2009 for $25.8 million or about 7.75% OCR.
</p>

<p>
In terms of Outlook, only 12.5% of respondents believe that Single Tenant Industrial values will increase during the next 12 months, versus 43.1% who forecast a decrease. In this survey, the results for Multi Tenant Industrial parallel Single Tenant Industrial in terms of yield expectation and Outlook.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R403&amp;period=110&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q3/17.gif"></a>This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation "Y" cohort, produces stable vacancies and stable cash flows. This sector also benefits from low cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be localized. The strongest demand is in the Montreal market with 8.0 buyers for every seller, followed by Vancouver with 6.0 buyers Demand is positive, but generally weaker in the west, with Edmonton at 1.3 buyers per seller and Calgary at 2.7 buyers for every seller.

The Downtown Multi Residential market appears to be searching for a point of stability, as investor's views diverge on both yields and unit values. OCRs range from a low of 4.6 % in Vancouver to a high of 6.8% in Halifax. A recent example of multi family activity is the August 2009 sale of the 70 unit Rue Riverside in St Lambert, Quebec. This 10 storey building, constructed in 1968, sold for $65,714 per unit or an OCR of 6.25%.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q3 2009 Investment Trends Survey reports growing signs of an end to the recessionary cycle in the Canadian commercial real estate market. Overall, the survey results reflect a more positive attitude and growing confidence in real estate investments, following a significant compression in asset values since the bull market peak in mid 2007. The Q3 2009 Survey certainly reflects stabilization in the yield requirements for prime retail, office and multi family assets, and mixed signals for industrial real estate. The commercial real estate market is experiencing a lag in recovery compared to other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock market and single family housing. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads is encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors on the sidelines. The wide range of investment yield results underscores the gap between buyer and seller expectations and many qualified buyers continue to await potential distress opportunities.
