<h2>Q1 2011 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market has successfully weathered the global economic downturn and has rebounded back to normal. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due in a large part to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, "normal" means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability of product, deep pools of equity and finally, active bidding for choice assets.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the commercial market has again moved into imbalance, due to a supply issue. Major property owners are highly motivated to buy because the Pension Funds, Life Companies and REITS are awash with cash and private investors again have access to low cost mortgage money. The lack of listings is causing multiple bids for each asset, which has again fueled significant and rapid compression in OCRs and IRRs. As a result, in Q1 2011, reported yields for most asset classes have decreased to within 10 bps to 30 bps of that experienced in the last cycle which peaked in late 2007.

The biggest emerging threat to our market is the cost of debt. As shown on the slide opposite. Depending on product type, between 45.8% and 53.1% of respondents believe that cost of first mortgage financing will increase during the next 3 months. The cost of debt, dictated by Government bond rates, is inextricably linked to global events and economic changes, and has less to do with demand and supply in the Canadian market. In addition to the threat of increased debt costs, the main perceived challenge is a lack of good quality properties to buy and the lag in delivery of new supply in the pipeline.

The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of the eight cities surveyed in Canada, as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investors rating of each city by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example in the most favoured centre, Vancouver, the 363 responses indicated an average of 2.6 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. By comparison, the least favoured location, Quebec City reported 1.2 buyers for every seller and has hovered around equilibrium between buyer and seller for the last three quarters. Vancouver has a projected GDP in 2011 of 3.5% and has historically commanded the lowest yields and highest prices of all the cities surveyed. Calgary has replaced Ottawa in second position, having improved from 1.8 buyers per seller to 2.5 in Q1 2011. As a result of rebounding energy prices and employment opportunities, Calgary will have a projected nationwide high GDP in 2011 of 3.6. Impressive absorption of Downtown office space, during the last 18 months has removed a major element of risk and balance has returned to Calgary's real estate sectors. Toronto, with a projected 2011 GDP of 2.9, (30 bps above the national average), has maintained a close third position on the barometer. Ottawa, Montreal and Edmonton remain in positive territory, but Quebec City and Halifax, being the smallest centres surveyed, are almost at equilibrium between buyers and sellers.

The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Montreal Downtown Class "AA" Office mirrors the national Outlook on trends for office assets. In our Q1 2010 survey, 24.4% of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class "AA" Office prices would decrease and 31.7% opined that prices would increase. In the current survey, attitudes are far more positive, with only 2.4% of respondents (red) indicating that Toronto Class AA Office values would decrease, 50.0% were of the opinion that values would increase and 47.6% indicated that values would remain stable. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/04.png"></a>
The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally is Suburban Multiple Unit Residential. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 36.8% of respondents forecast "No Change" in prices and 61.3% project an increase during the next 12 months. The Investor Outlook survey strongly endorses the concept of the market moving into an expansion phase, as only 1.9% of all respondents for Suburban Multi Residential predict a decrease in prices during the next 12 months.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Across all markets, 2010 saw a sharp decrease in yield requirements and increased asset values. In contrast, the Q1 2011 survey shows a slowing of price increases and a peaking in yield requirements. The replies in Q1 2011 indicate that only 50% of respondents are of the opinion that OCRs have decreased since the last quarter. By comparison, in Q4 2010, a significant 78.3% felt that yields had dropped. In terms of required IRRs, 47% of respondents report a decrease in property yields, compared to three months ago, when a whopping 97% reported falling yields and consequently increased values. These results are despite concerns over the European debt crisis and the impact of Canadian parity with the US dollar on exports. The recovery cycle appears to be over, prices are approaching a peak and demand for commercial real estate is sustained.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=116"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/05.png"></a>
The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. What is noteworthy are the much tighter "band widths" of opinions and a closure of the gap between buyer's bid prices and seller's asking prices.
The lowest "going in" yields are for Tier I Regional malls, reported in the 5.0% to 7.0% range, replacing Multiple Unit Residential as the lowest yielding property type. Respondents continue to express a high level of confidence with only 3.1% of replies suggesting that OCRs have increased during the last 3 months for the prime products surveyed.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=116"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/06.png"></a>
In terms of IRRs a degree of caution is being expressed in our respondent's in yield expectations. In this survey, only 15 categories, or 47% reported a decrease in required IRR, while 28% reported "No Change" and 25% reported an increase. This is in contrast to OCR expectations and the hesitancy may be in anticipation of an increase in the prime lending rate by the Bank of Canada.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/07.png"></a>
The current Property Type Barometer indicates that as the recovery cycle matures, momentum shifts are more balanced and measured. For example, the market's top preference, Tier I Regional Malls, reports 6.5 buyers for every seller, up marginally from the 6.2 buyers reported in the previous survey. As office occupancy improves and confidence in this asset class grows, Downtown Class "AA" office has crept up the charts to number 5 position, attracting 3.2 buyers for every seller. Food Anchored Retail and Power Centres, while remaining "top ten" choices, have slipped to number 4 and number 8 position respectively on the popularity chart. The emerging choice is Multi-Tenant and Single Tenant Industrial at number 2 and 3 position. Despite the positive responses for prime properties, secondary assets continue to receive bearish sentiment, with Suburban Class "B" Office, Hotels and Enclosed Community Malls being reported as the least preferred assets.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/08.png"></a> 
When combined with location Industrial product appears in six of the top seven choices. Of note, the western cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver predominate as the top seven choices on the Product/Market Barometer. Interestingly, Halifax emerges as a top ten choice for Tier I Regional Mall, but also has the least preferred or bottom three picks in respect of Downtown Land, Enclosed Community Mall and Suburban Class "B" Office.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=116&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/10.png"></a> <a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/09.png"></a>
The demand for Downtown Class "AA" Office investments continues to gain strength, on the heels of positive trends in the key Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary markets. The Barometer indicates decreased vacancies during the next 3 months in all Downtown locations, except Quebec City, Halifax or Edmonton where an increase in vacancy is expected. The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Toronto market.</p>

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=20&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/11.png"></a>
The market experienced a sustained bull run from Q4 2001 (8.4% OCR) to Q3 2007 (5.7%), then retreated until Q3 2009 (7.0%) and has recovered to an average OCR of 6.0% in Q1 2011. This demonstrates an impressive 100 bps rebound, positioning this asset class within 30 bps of the price peak in Q3 2007. This impressive performance is partly driven by an imbalance between demand and supply. The office supply pipeline is unable to deliver sufficient quantity of new product to meet heightened demand and buyer appetite. Existing owners continue to hold, rather than sell prime Class "AA" assets, because they have become virtually irreplaceable. In this survey, we also sought opinions on Class "AA" Office Leasehold. While yield expectations have compressed, the required discount or spread for leasehold risk and stigma is not surprisingly 30 to 50 bps compared to the Freehold Class "AA" Office assets surveyed. What is noteworthy is the spread of bandwidth of opinion and also the tightest spread between leasehold and freehold at 30 bps, being reported in the relatively sophisticated market of Montreal.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/13.png"></a> <a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S101&amp;period=116"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/12.png"></a>
Our Q1 2011 retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Food Anchored Strips and Power Centres and Respondents report that the retail investment market is strengthening, measured by increased values and decreased yields in all retail categories. The motivation for retail investment is illustrated on the slide opposite, which indicates that stability of income is the most important factor amongst Respondents. This may be explained by the consistently low vacancy experienced by retail properties across Canada. Debt Costs, Income Growth and Stability compared to other asset types follow as chosen factors. However, buyers remain selective and investment demand for retail fluctuates according to quality. For example nationally, there are currently 6.5 buyers for every seller for a Tier I Regional Mall, compared to 3.4 buyers for every seller for a Food Anchored Retail Strip. On the other hand, there are 1.3 sellers for every buyer for the less favoured and lower quality Enclosed Community Mall.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=116"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/14.png"></a>
The graph on the right highlights the fortunes of Tier I Regional Malls. The market peaked in Q3 2007 at a 5.4% OCR and gradually climbed to 6.7% in Q3 2009, then recovered by Q1 2011 to 5.7%, just 30 bps off the 2007 market peak. Food Anchored Retail Strip has also rebounded impressively and commands number four position on the Product Barometer. The current yield expectations are illustrated on the graph opposite. Currently, OCRs range from 6.2% to 6.6% in Western Canada and 6.6% to 7.4% in Eastern Canada. During the last 12 months, this represents a 50 bps improvement in the Vancouver and Montreal markets and ranges up to 80 bps in Ottawa. IRRs for this product range from a low of 7.4% in the top performing Vancouver market to 8.7% in Quebec City.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=9"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/15.png"></a>
Power Centres, while being viewed as being less attractive when measured on the product barometer, achieve lower yield results than the sought after Food Anchored Retail Strip product. The OCRs reported for Power Centres are 6.1% (Vancouver) to 7.0% (Halifax), which represent 10 to 40 bps less than its popular cousin, the Food Anchored Retail Strip.

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/17.png"></a> <a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/16.png"></a>
Industrial properties remain highly ranked asset choices, with Multi-Tenant Industrial and Single Tenant Industrial being ranked in second and third position respectively on the product barometer The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant Industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial range from 6.3% (Vancouver) to 7.8% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations. During the last 12 months, all locations have improved in value, demonstrated by a decrease in required OCRs of 60 bps (Vancouver) to 100 bps (Toronto and Ottawa). Despite this optimism, face rate increases for Toronto are in the 2.2% per annum range for the next 12 months, and a modest 0.4% to 0.7% in Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. The face rate growth predictions for 2012 and 2013 for Single Tenant Industrial are more optimistic, with annual growth of 1.7% to 3.0% per annum being reported.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=116"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/18.png"></a>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Multi Tenant Industrial range from 6.3% (Vancouver) to 8.0% (Quebec City) and again tend to be stronger in western locations. In Montreal, which was heavily impacted by the downturn in the manufacturing sector during the recession, the industrial market has rebounded. OCRs for Multi-Tenant Industrial reached 8.4% in Q4 2009 and are at 7.6% 15 months later. The main driver appears to be low vacancy, security of income stream, ability to arrange financing at low interest rates and robust demand. For example, in the Calgary market, the 118,000 sq ft Deerfoot Distribution Centre sold in February 2011 for $12.6 million or $106 per sq ft and indicated an OCR in the range of 6.5%.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/19.png"></a>
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. 
</p>

<p>
However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be localized. In this survey, the strongest demand appears to be in Calgary, with 13.0 buyers for every seller, followed by Toronto at 10.5 buyers per seller. The lowest demand emanates from Quebec City at 1.3 buyers and Vancouver at 1.5 buyers for every seller. The explanation reflects two different market extremes of higher vacancy and low demand in Quebec City ($110,000 per unit) and top shelf pricing in Vancouver. ($159,000 per unit)
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=116&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q1/20.png"></a>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 5.2% in Vancouver to 6.5% in Halifax. This investment type peaked earlier in the recovery cycle than other product types surveyed. This is partly explained by the fact that multiple residential remained a "sought after" asset class throughout the recession and was subject to less yield decompression. It also tends to be a more highly leveraged asset and is more prone to interest rate increases, which are beginning to loom.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market has just about returned to normalcy. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due in a large part to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, "normal" means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability, deep pools of equity and active bidding for choice assets that become available.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the commercial market has again moved into imbalance, due to the supply issue. Major property owners are highly motivated to buy because the Pension Funds, Life Companies and REITS are awash with cash and private investors again have access to low cost mortgage money. The lack of listings is causing multiple bids for each asset, which has again fueled significant and rapid compression in OCRs and IRRs. As a result, in Q1 2011, the reported yields for most asset classes have decreased to within 10 bps to 30 bps of that experienced in the market peak around late 2007.
