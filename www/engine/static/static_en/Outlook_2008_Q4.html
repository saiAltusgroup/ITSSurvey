The world financial crisis and the economic slowdown in Canada has finally caught up with the commercial property market. The weakening investment trends previously reported in the secondary markets, have now shifted to prime assets. The Q4 Investment Trends Survey reflects a growing erosion of demand and increasing yield requirements for prime retail, industrial and office properties. For the first time in the history of ITS, the Location Barometer shown on the right indicates bearish demand (more sellers than buyers) in all Canadian locations except Ottawa. The lack of available bank financing, coupled with growing economic weakness and unemployment, has dampened investor confidence in commercial real estate. In this deepening economic downturn, the only stability in prices and yields is reported for multi unit residential product.

The Investor Outlook Graph for Toronto Downtown Class AA Office underscores the “sea change” in investor outlook on property prices for first class assets. In our Q3 2008 survey, only 23% of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease during the next 12 months. Since the Q3 survey, the economic downturn has deepened, unemployment statistics look bleaker (particularly in Eastern Canada) and the West has been hit with sharply declining energy prices. In the Q4 2008 survey, 73% of respondents indicated that Class AA Office values would decrease (red) during the next 12 months, only 3.6% believe that they will increase (green) and 10.7% forecast no change (orange). This dramatic shift in investor confidence may have been an overreaction, but the sentiment applied to assets market wide, including Industrial and Tier I malls. The product attracting the greatest confidence was Multiple Unit Residential, and even then, only 40% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 57% predicted that prices will decrease during the next 12 months.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H203&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=107&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/03.gif"></a>
During early 2008, the Canadian commercial property investment market demonstrated remarkable staying power, despite weakening credit conditions. However, after some hesitancy, confidence has weakened and, as a result, investors require higher yields for all asset types. The Vancouver Class AA development yields graph on the right shows the yields for Vancouver Downtown Class AA Office investments and illustrates the bottoming of the yield curve and an upswing in 2008, reflecting the re-pricing of development risk. The six-year bull run in Canadian commercial real estate has clearly cycled out and signals the requirement for significantly higher yields.

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S305&amp;period=107&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/04.gif"></a>
Respondents indicate that yield requirements are now increasing across the board, as investors respond to the shortage of credit, anticipated weaker demand, increased vacancy and softening rents. The Q4 2008 Overall Capitalization Rates graph to the right of OCR yields compares different classes of assets in locations across Canada. Not surprisingly, the yields required in western locations are lower than the East by about 50 bps, reflecting the more robust demand for assets in the West. The West has – until recently - been insulated by the strong performance of the resource sector and has not faced the same levels of manufacturing layoffs and structural unemployment experienced in the East of the country.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The lowest yields predominate in the Multi Unit Residential sector in Vancouver at 5.4%. The highest yields required are in the smaller markets of Halifax and Quebec. A retrenchment by investors to the security of larger metropolitan areas mirrors the US market trend of the last two years. Downtown Class AA Office is a strong performer across the country, with the lowest yields in Vancouver at 6.2% and the upper range in Quebec City at 7.5%. Tier I Malls, although rarely available, also attract lower yields in most locations.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
Following six years of declining yield rates, OCR’s are starting to experience “decompression”, as investors discriminate between primary and secondary locations and first and second class assets. In this survey, the yield requirements for good quality assets increased by between 40 and 60 bps over those in Q1 2008. All other things being equal, this translates into a 10% to 12 % decline in asset value. The same trends are paralleled by the respondent’s opinion of appropriate IRR’s. Yields in secondary locations are not tracked as regularly, but will be more impacted by softening demand and typically attract leveraged buyers, particularly for sub prime assets and in markets where capital has dried up.

<h3 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R402&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/05.gif"></a>
The market’s top preference indicated by the Property Type Barometer for the current quarter, seen to the right, is for food anchored retail, with 2.3 buyers for every seller. The shrinkage in demand is underscored by the fact that in Q1 2008 there were 4.3 buyers for very seller of food anchored strip retail. Negative momentum and a thinning of demand is being reported for other previously sought after asset types, such as Tier I Regional Malls, Multiple Unit Residential and Industrial. As recessionary conditions build and credit remains tight, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Suburban Class B Office, Community Malls and Hotels being the least preferred assets.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R500&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/06.gif"></a>
The office vacancy outlook is a major feature of this investment class and the respondent’s view of during the next three months is pessimistic, as shown in the Office Vacancy Barometer national results chart on the right. The momentum outlook is negative for all markets except downtown Halifax. This is not surprising, given the volume of new supply under construction and the bearish projections for Toronto and Calgary. The government cities of Quebec City and Ottawa appear to attract more positive, albeit still bearish, vacancy predictions.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R404&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3,4,1,5,6,2&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/07.gif"></a>
The Rolling Four Quarter Property Type Barometer for office investments provides insight into how investor demand has shifted during the last 12 months. One year ago the market was bullish for all office product types, except Class B suburban Office. As the economy slumped and investor appetite weakened, only Downtown Class AA Office attracts positive demand, albeit with only 1.2 buyers for every seller. Office land, Downtown Class B and Suburban Office all report more sellers than buyers and bearish sentiment.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/08.gif"></a>
The Valuation Parameters graph on the right for Downtown Class AA Office indicates that respondents expressed their weakening sentiment for Class AA Office product by requiring higher “going in” yields, with overall cap rates in the 6.2 % to 7.5% range, up by 30 to 70 bps compared to the last survey. The greatest increases in OCR and IRR yield requirements were in Calgary and Toronto, markets which are facing significant new supply. The combination of increased yield requirements and retreating demand spells a cycling out of the sustained interest in office investments during the last 5 years.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Retail</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H402&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=8&amp;market_1=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=107&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/09.gif"></a>
Our Q4 retail survey included Tier I and Tier II Regional Malls and Community Malls. Respondents reported a retail investment market correction, expressed in terms of a bearish shift on the barometer and much higher yield requirements. The graph on the right highlights the rapidly declining fortunes of Tier II Regional Malls. The combination of financing challenges, a higher perception of risk and soft consumer spending patterns has pushed this once revered asset class into negative territory, with 1.9 sellers for every buyer.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=7&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/10.gif"></a>
The market meltdown is highlighted by the shift in yield expectations for Tier I Malls, illustrated on the valuation parameters graph on the right. In the stronger western cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver, OCR yields increased by 40 to 60 bps since Q3 2008, while in the more distressed eastern markets yields increased by 50 to 70 bps. Concurrently, the Barometer for Tier I Malls and Investor Outlook underscored a significant decline in investor confidence. The Community Mall, the “poor cousin” of our retail survey, reported OCR’s of 7.2 % in Vancouver to 8.6 % in Halifax, an increase of 70 to 130 bps from 12 months ago.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=13&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=5&amp;period=107&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/11.gif"></a>
Single and Multi Tenant Industrial properties remain top ranked asset choices, but are still subject to the impact of vacancy, plant closures and reduced shipping requirements during tougher economic times. Industrial investments remain in positive territory on the Property Barometer, but demand has fallen to 1.2 buyers for every seller for Single Tenant properties. The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for the last 12 months for Single Tenant industrial in the Calgary market. The relatively flat OCR and IRR yield requirements during the first 9 months of 2008, jumped by 60 bps in Q4 and concurrently, price per sq ft declined by about 10%. Overall, values dropped by 10% over a 12 month period.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
A total of 77% of respondents to the Investor Outlook for Multiple Tenant Industrial anticipate that values will decline further during the next 12 months. The sense is that values will return to more traditional norms of OCR’s in the 7.5% to 8.5% range as property investment risk and liquidity is re-evaluated.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S102&amp;period=107&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/12.gif"></a>
This asset class remains the most stable property investment type and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Multiple Unit Residential produces low vacancies and strong cash flow, supported by positive demographics and a sticky home ownership market. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation “Y” cohort, produces stable vacancies and stable cash flows. The motivation graph to the right clearly demonstrates the attraction of this asset class to investors, with stability of value and income and ability to leverage with CMHC support highlighted as positive motives.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=107&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2008_Q4/13.gif"></a>
Interestingly, despite very positive investment attributes, Multiple Residential has not been entirely immune to the correction in demand and values reported in other investment types. The graph on the right summarizes the Q4 valuation parameters for this asset type. Yield requirements have increased by between 30 bps (Toronto and Ottawa) and 80 bps (Calgary and Edmonton) during the last 12 months. The largest jump took place during the last quarter, with an upward shift in OCR yields of between 10 and 30 bps. Multi Residential is predicted to sustain its top ranking, due to the lack of availability and the wide gap between buyer and seller expectations.
</p>

<h3 style="clear:both;">Summary</h3>

<p style="clear:both;">
In summary, Canada is experiencing the same downward shift in demand and upward shift in yield requirements that were recorded in the USA 12 to 18 months ago. However, the correction to date has been more modest, due to conservative banking and lending practices and a disciplined supply pipeline, except in the Calgary and Toronto office markets. As investor confidence erodes, the expectation gap between sellers looking at last year’s prices and buyers anticipating next year’s pricing may well begin to narrow. This should alleviate the present conundrum facing respondents and market participants, of having very few transactions on which to gauge the pace and momentum of the downturn.
