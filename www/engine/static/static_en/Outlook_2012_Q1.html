<h2>Q1 2012 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2012 Investment Trends Survey indicates that the current bull cycle in the Canadian commercial property market continues to demonstrate very positive momentum. The Canadian market continues to benefit from low interest rates, a shortage of supply and an imposed discipline in the commercial development sector. The industry appears to be largely insulated from global events, such as the European sovereign debt crisis, softening economic outlook in Asia or the US political gridlock.The Investment Trends Survey reports a positive start to 2012 with continued compression in yields, increasing rents and a run up in values. Yields have not yet compressed to the point of investor discomfort and confidence is sustaining.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
Comparisons are made between the current cycle and the last bull cycle, which peaked around Q2 2007. One measure is the relative level of interest rates. In Q2 2007, the 10-year Government of Canada bond rate was around 4.0%, versus the current rate of 2.0%, a full 200 basis points less. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
We are 24 months into the current bull cycle, but how much longer can it sustain? At current values, vendors are motivated and the supply of product is improving, as the major pension funds and REITS take this opportunity to rationalize their holdings or to take a profit. Currently, the European debt crisis is easing and the US economic downturn is showing signs of bottoming. The one factor, which could stall the current cycle, is interest rates. The Bank of Canada has expressed concern about the level of consumer household debt and is signaling the potential for an increase in interest rates. All other factors point to sustained demand, excellent liquidity and very competitive bidding by buyers for available product
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Location Barometer</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/01.png"></a> 
The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of the eight cities surveyed in Canada as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investors rating of each city by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example, in Calgary, the most favoured centre for the last 2 quarters, the responses indicated an average of 2.8 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. Positive momentum was indicated for the three Western Canadian cities of Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver and a downward shift in momentum for eastern locations and the Maritimes. Calgary, fuelled by a buoyant energy sector with an abundant appetite for new downtown office product, has ranked in the top three investment locations on the Location Barometer during the last 12 months. Edmonton, benefitting from the strong Alberta economy and positive GDP projections by the Conference Board of Canada has moved up to second place from number four position. Vancouver, traditionally a popular choice, moved into number three position in this survey. Toronto and Ottawa have lost traction with 1.9 and 1.6 buyers per seller and Montreal, the least preferred location in our last survey, moved up to number 6 position. Quebec City has been bounced around on the barometer, and in this survey, dropped from number 3 to bottom position, with 1.4 buyers for every seller.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Investor Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H100&amp;product_1=4&amp;property_1=15&amp;market_1=5&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=120"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/02.png"></a> 
The Investor Outlook charts the attitude of respondents to the strength of the future market, expressed as opinion of value trend. For example, for Suburban Multiple Unit Residential in Ottawa, 38.5% of respondents predict "no change" in values for the next 12 months, down from 58.3% in the last quarter. A total of 61.5% of respondents indicated an increase in values, up from 41.7% in the last quarter The sentiment for a decrease was nil, as it has been in Ottawa for the last three quarters The Investor Outlook for Suburban Multiple Unit Residential for Ottawa during the last 6 months parallels the national trend in responses for most product types.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=120"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/03.png"></a>
This graph compares OCRs for different types of assets in the hub cities across Canada. The Q1 2012 results clearly demonstrate continued compression in OCRs with 28% of product/locations showing "no change" (stability) and 72% indicating lower OCRs (compression). The greatest compression, quarter over quarter, in the order of 10 to 30 bps was in respect of Class "AA" office and Tier I Regional Mall. More significant is that for a number of products and locations, OCRs are now lower than those reported in the last market peak in Q2 2007. This is a clear signal that the current market cycle has yet to bottom out and that yields continue to compress. 
</p>

<p>
In terms of IRRs, our respondents are equally bullish, with quarter over quarter results demonstrating significant IRR compression. Only 15.6% of respondents thought that IRRs had increased; 21.8% consider them to be the same but 62.5% believe that IRRs have decreased. The overall impression one is left with, is that yields have yet to reach bottom and investor appetite is still strong.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/04.png"></a>
There has been a significant repositioning of property preference in Q1 2012. Multi Tenant and Single Tenant Industrial replaced retail options as the number one and two choices, with 9.0 and 6.5 buyers for very seller respectively. Tier 1 Regional Mall (5.0 buyers for every seller) and Food Anchored Retail Strip (4.4 sellers for every buyer) have slipped to number 3 and 4 positions, while Downtown Class "AA" Office has moved down to fifth position from number three. Interestingly, Downtown Office Land maintained a top ten position, underscoring a new office construction cycle in many locations. The largest upward move from the last survey was Multi Tenant Industrial, which moved into number one position from tenth position. The other noteworthy product is Hotels, which moved into positive territory at 1.3 buyers per seller for the first time since the economic crash. As the cycle strengthens, only 2 products, namely Suburban Office Land and Suburban Class "B" Office remain in negative position, characterized by an excess of sellers over buyers.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/05.png"></a>
The Office sector has rebounded in popularity during the last 18 months, but the Q1 2012 Office Vacancy Barometer, a forecast of office vacancy trends, indicates some signs of retrenchment. Weaker results are indicated for all locations except for Downtown and Suburban Calgary, which has seen a dramatic drop in vacancy as a result of increased hiring activity in the Oil and Gas sector. Most caution is expressed for the office sector in Ottawa, where Downtown and Suburban office vacancy is projected to increase over the next three months. Vacancy is also projected to increase in Suburban Class "B" Office in Toronto and Montreal.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/06.png"></a>
The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite. The OCRs for Class AA Office now range from 5.45% in Vancouver to 6.8% in Halifax and Quebec City. In all locations, OCRs now equal or surpass those reported at the height of the last cycle in Q2 2007. For example, in Vancouver, the OCR last peaked in Q2 2007 at 5.7% and currently sits at 5.4%, a full 30 bps lower. The exceptions are Calgary and Edmonton where the Q1 2012 OCRs equal the last peak result in 2007.
</p>

<p>
The same results are indicated for Downtown Class AA Office IRRs, which sit from 10 bps (Halifax) to 60 bps lower (Vancouver and Montreal) than the 2007 market peak yields. This can partially be explained by the fact that 10 year Government of Canada Bonds are currently yielding around 2.0% versus about 4.0% in 2007. 

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=20"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/07.png"></a>
The investment parameters for Downtown Class "AA" Office Leasehold is illustrated on the slide opposite. The OCRs range from 5.8% to 7.3%, a discount of 30 to 40 bps over the "freehold" Downtown AA investments. The IRRs indicate a similar spread requirement of 20 to 40 bps and basically reflect the discount required for lack of reversion, land lease payments and less liquidity for a leasehold investment.

The investment parameters for Suburban Class "B" Office are illustrated on the slide opposite, in respect of the Toronto market. The current OCR of 6.8% is 20bps lower than at the market peak reported in Q1 2007 and the current IRR of 7.9% is 40 bps lower than the 2007 IRR of 8.3%. Interestingly, the current unit price of $249.29 per sq ft is 17.24% higher than reported in Q1 2007. 

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R201&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/09.png"></a>
The Q1 2012 survey also addresses Market Face Rates for Suburban Class "B" Office. The highest face rates are reported in Calgary at $19.99 per sq ft, closely followed by Vancouver at $18.20 per sq ft. The lowest rates are in Quebec, with Quebec City at $13.15 per sq ft and Montreal at $13.69 per sq ft. The face rates reported for Halifax, Montreal and Toronto ranging from $13.69 to $16.81 per sq ft establish record highs for those locations, whereas the Alberta locations fall short of the face rates achieved during the 2007 market peak.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/10.png"></a>
The Q1 2012 survey addressed parameters for Tier I Regional Malls, Food Anchored Retail Strip and Power Centres. Tier I Regional Malls, while rarely available or sold, have slipped in popularity on the Property Type Barometer. In terms of location, Ottawa is the top choice, with 8.0 buyers for every seller, followed by Calgary at 6.3. The least popular locations for Tier I Regional Mall are in the Province of Quebec, with Quebec City at 2.4 buyers for every seller and Montreal at 3.5 buyers for every seller. Interestingly, the top location choices for Food Anchored Retail Strip are Vancouver and Montreal and for Power Centres, Edmonton and Calgary top the list.

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=9"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/11.png"></a>
Food Anchored Retail Strip is in number four position on the Property Type Barometer, but is experiencing negative momentum. OCRs are in the 5.9% to 7.1% range, having reached or exceeded the 2007 peak OCRs in all locations except Calgary. Food Anchored Retail Strip is less popular in Calgary and the Q1 2012 OCR reported of 6.1% is still 10 bps above its 2007 peak.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S101&amp;period=120"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/12.png"></a>
What makes retail investment so attractive to investors? This slide asks respondents to rank their major motives for retail investment and not surprisingly, 81.8% ranked "stability of income" as the major motivational factor. Low vacancy has been a prime feature of retail investments. In second place, "Debt Costs" was ranked by 63.2% of respondents, followed by "Income Growth". Lesser emphasis was placed on "Capital Growth" or "High Cost of New Construction"
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/13.png"></a>
Industrial properties have rebounded strongly in this survey, to produce all the top five choices in the accompanying Product/Market Type Barometer chart. Edmonton Multi-Tenant Industrial at 25 buyers for every seller and Single Tenant Industrial with 24 buyers for every seller occupy the top positions of all product/location choices in Canada. This is followed by Single and Multi-Tenant Industrial in Calgary and Multi-Tenant Industrial in Vancouver to round out the top 5 choices.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/14.png"></a>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial have compressed by 10 to 20 bps since the last survey. The western cities report OCRs of 6.0% to 6.5% and IRRs of 7.2% to 7.7%. The major hub of Toronto is in a similar range. Ottawa, Quebec locations and Halifax report a higher range of OCRs of 6.5% to 7.7% and IRRs of 7.7% to 8.5% for Single Tenant Industrial. The rebound in Industrial yields in this cycle has lagged that of office and retail products. OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial have only exceeded their 2007/2008 market peak in one location, namely Ottawa (6.5% OCR) and only by 10bps. In Vancouver, the Q3 2007 record of 6.0% OCR was equaled in this survey but in other locations, OCR results lag their peak by up to 10 to 20 bps.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=2&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=120"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/15.png"></a>
Turning to Multi-Tenant Industrial, the current OCR for Edmonton Multi-Tenant Industrial of 6.5%, is 10 bps off its historic peak in Q2 2007, but the IRR at 7.7% is also 10 bps lower than the Q2 2007 IRR. The current price per sq ft of $124.14 exceeds the price in Q2 2007 of $108.14 per sq ft by a wide margin The Edmonton experience mirrors the national performance for Multi Tenant Industrial, as it edges towards or marginally exceeds the peak 2007 yield rates.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. This product continues to retain its top five position on the product preference barometer.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/16.png"></a>
In terms of location, Ottawa maintains its status as the most preferred location followed by Toronto and Montreal as indicated in the accompanying chart. Although the Edmonton and Calgary buy/sell ratio is at zero, it simply means that this market is at equilibrium (i.e. equal number of buyers and sellers). The Multiple Unit Residential survey shows shrinking demand compared to the last two quarters. For example, in Halifax demand shifted from 5.0 buyers for every seller in Q4 2011 to 1.2 buyers in this survey - quite a dramatic downturn.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=120&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2012_Q1/17.png"></a>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 4.5% in Vancouver to a high of 6.1% in Halifax. These rates equal the 2007 market peak in Calgary and Edmonton, but establish record low OCRs in other locations like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City, by as much as 60 bps. The low OCRs can be attributed to the fact that this asset class remained a "sought after" group and vacancy has been declining nationwide. The unit prices of $173,429 (Vancouver) to $117,500 (Quebec City) demonstrate a healthy rebound and in some cases, such as Halifax, Toronto and Vancouver a record price level in the history of the ITS survey.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2012 Investment Trends Survey indicates that the current bull cycle in the Canadian commercial property market, continues to demonstrate very positive momentum. The Canadian market benefits from low interest rates, a shortage of supply and an imposed discipline in the commercial development sector.
