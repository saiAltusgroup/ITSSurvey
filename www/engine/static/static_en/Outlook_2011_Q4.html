<h2>Q4 2011 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q4 2011 Investment Trends Survey suggests that the current Canadian commercial property market cycle, characterized by falling yields and higher values for all property categories, is peaking. While Canada has benefitted from low interest rates, a highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector, it is not completely insulated from global events and a pending economic slowdown.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey reports a positive year in 2011 with a run up in values, but caution is setting in and demand has potentially peaked .Yields have compressed to the point of investor discomfort and confidence is beginning to slip. The combination of the international financial crisis connected to sovereign debt issues in Europe, softening economics in China and political gridlock in the USA, is beginning to have an impact. On the debt side, the Bank of Canada appears to be holding the line on interest rates for the foreseeable future. The direct and measurable correlation between bond rates and mortgage rates is a significant factor causing leveraged investors to exercise more caution in making acquisition decision.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The "sea change" from our last survey, just three months ago, is signaled by a fall in demand on the Investor Outlook barometer and a pause in the 24 month downward spiral of yield rates. Is this just a pause, while investors take a "breather" to weigh up the recent fiscal policy changes in the euro zone and US Congress, or does it represent a market peak in prices? Only time will tell.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Location Barometer</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/01.png"></a> The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of the eight cities surveyed in Canada as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investors rating of each city by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example, in Calgary, the most favoured centre this quarter, the Q4/11 responses indicated an average of 2.8 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. Calgary, fuelled by a buoyant energy sector with an abundant appetite for new downtown office product, has ranked in the top three investment locations on the ITS barometer during the last 12 months. Ottawa, the top pick in the Q3 survey and still a very stable investment location, has lost momentum and slipped to sixth place. Toronto, in second place, is the largest commercial investment market in Canada, and has ascended in popularity from sixth place at mid year. Quebec City in third position, has been bounced around on the barometer this year, but has attracted attention as being a stable government centre and relatively attractive investment location. In our survey, Quebec City has consistently produced lower prices and higher yields for most categories of real estate surveyed.
</p>

<p>
Vancouver, the highest priced market in the survey and in a post Olympics economy, has been losing momentum on the location barometer since Q2 2011. Edmonton, benefitting from the Alberta Advantage, has positive momentum and had maintained its position in the middle of the pack. Montreal is least favoured, but has been in positive territory all year with between 1.6 and 1.8 buyers for every seller.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investor Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H100&amp;product_1=4&amp;property_1=15&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=5&amp;period=119"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/02.png"></a> The Investor Outlook charts the attitude of respondents to the strength of the future market, expressed as opinion of value trend. For example, for Suburban Multiple Unit Residential in Montreal, 45.5% of respondents predict "no change" in values for the next 12 months, whereas 54.5% indicated an increase in values. The sentiment for a decrease was nil. However, the bullishness of these responses is more tempered than six months ago, when 75% of respondents for Montreal Multiple Unit Residential predicted that values would increase and only 25% predicted "no change". This shift to a more cautious attitude to value trends is reported for most product types. While most respondents predict stability in values, does this shift signal a market peak? Have yields compressed to their low point in the latest growth cycle? Are global risk factors and the pending economic slowdown beginning to outweigh acquisition pressure?
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=119"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/03.png"></a> This graph compares OCRs for different types of assets in the hub cities across Canada. In our year end survey, OCRs have compressed significantly from 12 months ago. The largest downward shift was 40 to 60 bps for Downtown Class "AA" Office and Suburban Multiple Unit Residential, followed by Single Tenant Industrial which declined 20 to 40 bps and Tier l Regional Mall by 20 to 30 bps. The Q4 2011 results clearly demonstrate a sea change in appetites with 47% of product/locations showing "no change" and 47% indicating lower OCRs compared to the last quarter. The western locations were more bullish overall, with Calgary and Edmonton being in somewhat of a "catch up" mode. Key questions arise from this data. Is this a signal that the current bullish cycle is bottoming out and that values are peaking? Are investors sufficiently troubled by international economic and fiscal turmoil that the market needs to take a breather?
</p>

<p>
In terms of IRRs, our respondents are more contrarian. While year over year results demonstrate significant IRR compression, a comparison to the Q3 2011 results indicate that confidence is definitely waning. Only 28% of respondents thought that IRRs had come down; 31.25% consider them to be the same but a whopping 40% believe that IRRs have increased. The one property type which has attracted the greatest skepticism is Suburban Multiple Unit Residential, although empirical data for IRRs for Multi Residential is "thin". The overall impression one is left with is that yields have reached a plateau for now, as the market reassesses the way forward.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/04.png"></a> There has been a limited repositioning of property type demand in Q4 2011. The most preferred property type continues to be Tier 1 Regional Mall (8.0 buyers for every seller), followed by Food Anchored Retail Strip (5.3 sellers for every buyer). Downtown Class "AA" Office has moved up from 6th position to number three. Interestingly, only one product type in the top ten, Tier II Regional Mall has positive momentum. The largest upward move from the last survey is Downtown Class "B" Office, which moved into 6th position with 3.0 buyers for every seller. This mirrors the countrywide decline in Downtown vacancy rates and the firming up, of office rental rates.
</p>

<p>
Outside of the top four choices, demand is flattening as investors grapple with the uncertain economic environment. The Bank of Canada, while maintaining record low interest rates, has predicted a more tempered pace for Canada as the slow moving United States economy keeps a lid on economic growth. Enclosed Community Malls (1.2 buyers for every seller) has emerged from the basement and is now in 13th position on the barometer. Suburban Office Land, Suburban Class "B" Office and Hotel continue to occupy the bottom positions on the barometer.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/05.png"></a> The demand for Downtown Class "AA" Office investments continues to gain strength, on the heels of positive absorption in the key Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary markets. The Barometer indicates increased momentum during the next 3 months in most downtown locations, particularly in Calgary, which has seen a dramatic decrease in vacancy as the Oil and Gas sector increased output and hiring activity. Despite positive economic forecasts, some caution is expressed within the Downtown Class "B" Office sector in Ottawa and Halifax, as vacancy is expected to increase over the next three months.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=119"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/06.png"></a> The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Montreal. The market experienced a sustained run up from the bottom of the recession in Q2 2009 (7.5% OCR) to the current 6.2% OCR, a 130 bps compression. Concurrently, unit prices increased from $269 per sq ft in Q2 2009 to $321 in this survey. Of interest, Montreal Downtown Class "AA" Office OCR now sits 20 bps less than at the last market peak in Q3 2008. The Q4 2011 Downtown Class "AA" Office market is lead by Vancouver at 5.5% OCR, ($487 PSF) Toronto at 5.7% ($452) and Calgary at 5.9% ($463 PSF). This year has witnessed sustained absorption in a number of cities, resulting in vacancy rates falling to around the 5% mark. However, developers are more cautious in initiating the next construction cycle, due to predictions of a slower economy.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/07.png"></a> The popularity of retail product is underscored by it being ranked in three out of the top 5 positions on the Product Type Barometer. The Q4 2011 survey addressed valuation parameters and outlook for Tier I and Tier II Regional malls and Enclosed Community Malls. These represent very contrasting retail asset types as demonstrated by the survey responses. Tier I Regional Malls are the top pick on the Product Barometer with 8.0 buyers per seller. It is a "sought after" asset, but is rarely available. The chart opposite demonstrates a tight band of yield rates across Canada, with OCRs reported at 5.4% in Vancouver up to 6.4% in Halifax and the trend of OCRs being "the same" or lower
in this survey.

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=11&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=119"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/08.png"></a> Tier II Regional Malls are in number five position on the Product Barometer and with positive momentum. OCRs are up 40 to 50 bps during the last year and IRRs 30 to 50 bps. This is an example of investors moving to secondary product to achieve their acquisition goals. Another example of this shift in investor focus is Enclosed Community Malls. The market peak in Calgary for this product was in Q2 2007 at a 6.5% OCR and 7.9% IRR. Currently, the OCR stands at 6.7%, just 20 bps off the 2007 record. The growing attraction of Enclosed Community Malls in Calgary is low vacancy, limited replacement opportunities and steady consumer spending patterns.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R132&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/09.png"></a> The slide opposite documents respondents' opinion of the typical year 1-5 Rental Rate for the benchmark Multi Tenant Industrial Building. The average rates reported are in the higher range in Western Canada, from $7.56 per sq ft in Vancouver to $8.71 per sq ft in Calgary. The Central and Eastern locations report $5.53 per sq ft in Montreal to $7.16 per sq ft in Ottawa. The regional differences can partly be explained by the buoyant resource base of western cities and the demand for new buildings, which has a "cost pull" influence. The eastern locations have been more prone to plant closure and rationalization and serve a US export market, which has been weakened by the near par exchange rate. Over the last 12 months all locations except Halifax (-3.5%) and Montreal (0%) reported increases in industrial rents of between 2.9% and 9.81%. Not surprisingly, the largest increase of 9.81% was reported in Edmonton, followed by Calgary at 9.28%.

Industrial properties have slipped in ranking, with Single-Tenant Industrial in Edmonton moving from first to eighth position in the accompanying Property Type and Product/Market Type Barometer charts. In national terms, the once favoured Single-Tenant Industrial is now ranked 7th and Multi-Tenant Industrial in 10th position on the Property Type Barometer. One possible explanation is that industrial investments were in high demand, as a place of safety, and became over-priced. Recently, other property types, particularly Downtown "AA" Office, have improved in both performance and relative attractiveness compared to industrial investments.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/12.png"></a> In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial have compressed by 20 to 50 bps over the last 12 months. The western cities report OCRs of 6.2% to 6.6% and IRRs of 7.1% to 7.6%. The major hub of Toronto is in a similar range. Ottawa, Quebec and Halifax report a higher range of OCRs of 6.7% to 7.9% and IRRs of 7.5% to 9.0% for Single Tenant Industrial.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=119"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/13.png"></a> In terms of historical valuation parameters, the current OCR for Toronto Multi-Tenant Industrial of 6.6%, is 30 bps off its historic peak in Q2 2007, but the IRR at 7.5% matches the Q3 2007 peak at the same rate. The current price per sq ft of $92.14 falls shy of the peak price in Q2 2007 of $98.88 per sq ft. The Toronto experience mirrors the national performance for Multi Tenant Industrial, which has yet to return to peak 2007 market levels.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. This product continues to retain its top five position on the product preference barometer.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/14.png"></a> In terms of location, Ottawa seems to be the most preferred location followed by Halifax and Toronto as indicated in the accompanying chart. Although the Edmonton buy/sell ratio is at zero, it simply means that this market is at equilibrium (i.e. equal number of buyers and sellers). The Multiple Unit Residential survey also mirrors other products in terms of shrinking demand compared to the last quarter. For example, in Ottawa demand shifted from 15 buyers for every seller in Q3 2011 to 6.0 buyers in this survey - quite a dramatic downturn.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=119&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q4/15.png"></a> The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 4.6% in Vancouver to a high of 6.3% in Halifax. The low OCRs can be attributed to the fact that this asset class remained a "sought after" group and vacancy has been declining nationwide. The unit prices of $168, 657 (Vancouver) to $91,000 (Quebec City) demonstrate a healthy 10% to 15% rebound from values indicated 12 months ago.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey reports a positive year with a run up in values, but caution is setting in and demand has potentially peaked. This "sea change" from our last survey, just three months ago, is signaled by a fall in demand on the Investor Outlook barometer and a pause in the 24 month downward spiral of yield rates. The combination of international financial crisis connected to sovereign debt issues in Europe, softening economics in China and political gridlock in the USA is beginning to have an impact. On the debt side, the Bank of Canada appears to be holding the line on interest rates for the foreseeable future. However, the direct and measurable correlation between bond rates and mortgage rates is a significant factor causing leveraged investors to exercise more caution in making acquisition decisions. Is this change merely a pause while investors take a "breather" to weigh up the recent fiscal policy changes in the euro zone and US Congress or does it represent a market peak in prices? The results of the next quarterly survey will provide insight into this question.
