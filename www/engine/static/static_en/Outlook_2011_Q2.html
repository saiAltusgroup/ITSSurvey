<h2>Q2 2011 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market continues to successfully weather the global turmoil and for the most part has rebounded back to a healthy level if not yet to pre-recessionary conditions. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due mostly to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, "normal" means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability of product, deep pools of equity and finally, active bidding for choice assets.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the commercial market has again moved into imbalance, due to a supply issue. Major property owners are highly motivated to buy because the Pension Funds, Life Companies and REITS are awash with cash and private investors again have access to low cost mortgage money. The lack of listings is causing multiple bids in all asset classes, which has again fueled significant and rapid compression in OCRs and IRRs. As a result, in Q1 2011 and Q2 2011, reported yields for most asset classes have decreased to within 10 bps to 30 bps of that experienced in the last cycle which peaked in late 2007.
</p>

One of the threats perceived with the recovery is an interest rate hike. The chart on the right shows the impact on OCR if the interest rate hike is 1.0%. Nearly 77% of the respondents are of the opinion that OCRs will increase by 25&nbsp;-&nbsp;50 basis points, which directly impacts the values of the assets. Another threat, particularly to the Industrial asset class, is the continued sluggish recovery in the United States, which impacts Canadian manufacturing and trade. Recent market reports indicate that investor confidence in the US recovery is pessimistic given indications of lower retail sales, modest housing starts, high oil prices, and low employment growth.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R401&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/02.png"></a>
The location barometer summarizes the relative appeal of the eight cities surveyed in Canada, as commercial property investment locations. This barometer measures investors rating of each city by comparing the number of buyers to sellers. For example in the most favoured centre, Calgary, the 459 responses indicated an average of 2.4 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. This is expected given the rebound of energy prices and increased employment in the City. Impressive absorption of Downtown office space during the last 18 months has removed a major element of risk and balance has returned to Calgary's real estate sectors. By comparison, the least favoured location, Halifax, reported 1.3 buyers for every seller. Vancouver, which was in top spot the previous quarter, has slid to third place, whereas Quebec City, which was in last place previously, is now the second most favoured location in the country. Given the historical lower valuations seen in Quebec City, it is now in favour due to impressive yield returns. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/03.png"></a>
The product gaining traction after a period of extended slump is Downtown Class "AA" Office. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 54.5% of respondents forecast an increase in value parameters in the next 12 months, while 40% anticipated "no change". This reveals a more positive outlook for this asset class since it suggests stability of this group at minimum with potential for increased asset values. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=117"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/04.png"></a>
The graph of OCRs compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. In the second quarter of 2011 some improvement in OCRs and IRRs was seen across nearly all the major sectors. The replies in Q2 2011 indicate that, for OCRs, 44% of respondents believe rates have decreased, 53% believe rates have remained the same, and only 3% believe that rates have increased. On the same note, among IRR trends, 34% of respondents believe rates have decreased, 40% think rates have remained the same, and 26% believe rates have increased. 
</p>

<p>
The "band width" of opinions of rates has remained the same for the most part, 5.0% to 8.0% for most regions. Outliers were observed within multi-tenant residential in the Vancouver market with the lowest rate indicated at 4.0%. This can be attributed to the continued increase in cost of home-ownership in that market, which results in increased demand for rental properties. In contrast, highest rates were observed consistently among single tenant industrials in the eastern market of Montreal, Quebec City, and Halifax, which were above 8.0%. This is expected since the manufacturing sector in the eastern Provinces are still in recovery stage, especially in light of the strong Canadian dollar and increased trade barriers under the current US administration. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=117"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/05.png"></a>
In terms of IRRs a continued cautionary stance is being expressed in our respondent categories as noted above. The typical range observed is from 6.0% at the low end for Downtown Class "AA" office and Tier 1 Regional Malls in Vancouver to 10.0% at the upper end for Multi-tenant residential in nearly all major cities. Most notable increases were observed in Montreal and Quebec City, where outlier rates above 12.0% were reported. The large "band width" observed in the Province of Quebec is not unusual as investor sentiments tend to vary widely in this region. This is partly due to the very diverse range of products available in this market. 
</p>

<p>
In summary, the overall investor sentiment reflects a stabilization of rates from the previous quarter, with some exceptions in some asset classes and locations. Thus in terms of values, no major changes are expected, despite ongoing concerns with Eurozone and restrictive regulations between US and Canada trade. In general, the higher IRR expectations for some products and markets may be in anticipation of possible increases in the prime lending rate by the Bank of Canada.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/06.png"></a>
There has been a dramatic repositioning of property type demand in the second quarter of 2011. The lead position is now held by Multi-Tenant Industrial (4.5 buyers for every seller) displacing former lead Tier 1 Regional Mall to fourth place. Interest for the latter has drastically decreased by half to 3.2 buyers for every seller. 
</p>

<p>
The others in the Top 5 positions include Multi-tenant Residential (up from 6<sup>th</sup> position), Downtown Class "AA" office (up from 5<sup>th</sup> position), and Food Anchored Retail strip (down from 4<sup>th</sup> position). There has also been a gradual upward shift of all Office related property types, including Downtown Office Land, which is currently at 7<sup>th</sup> position with 2.2 buyers for every seller. This suggests that the national sentiment for office property type is gradually improving after taking a severe hit during the downturn. Alternatively there has been little to no change in bearish sentiments among the laggards, which include REIT units, Enclosed Community Malls, Hotels and Suburban Class "B" Office. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
Enclosed Community Malls in smaller urban markets have fared the worst due to a combination of high vacancies and operating costs, and increased competition from new format regional centers. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R400&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/07.png"></a>
Two significant changes can be identified in the Product/Market Barometer chart. First, the recent dominance of the western regions in the "Top 15" is finally broken by the emergence of Halifax, Quebec City, and Toronto. This suggests that the eastern regions are starting to display signs of recovery across various sectors after a long sluggish period. Secondly, retail products have been almost entirely replaced in the "Top 15" category by Office, Industrial and Residential products. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R500&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/08.png"></a>
The demand for Downtown Class "AA" Office investments continues to gain strength, on the heels of positive trends in the key Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary markets. The Barometer indicates increased momentum during the next 3 months in several downtown locations, except in Halifax, Ottawa and Edmonton where vacancy is expected to increase. A notable jump from 1.8 to 9.8 in the momentum ratio was recorded for the downtown Toronto Office market, reflecting the current lack of new supply. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=117"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/09.png"></a>
The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Toronto market. The market experienced a sustained bull run from Q4 2001 (8.4% OCR) to Q3 2007 (5.7%), then retreated until Q3 2009 (7.0%) and has recovered to an average OCR of just below 6.0% in Q2 2011. This demonstrates an impressive 100 bps rebound, positioning this asset class within 30 bps of the price peak in Q3 2007. Complimenting the preceding sentiment of reduced vacancy, there was a sharp rise in rates per square foot from previous quarter. As expected, further declines or stability in IRRs, OCRs, and TCRs were observed. This impressive performance is mostly driven by an imbalance between demand and supply.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
There appears to be a shift towards a bearish attitude from investors toward retail investments among all classes as indicated in the Product/Market Barometer. Retail has generally led the pack among investor preference through most of the recession. This was due to consistently low vacancy, low debt costs, income growth, and stability exhibited by retail compared to other asset types. As a result, cap rates have dropped to nearly pre-recessionary levels. For trophy assets OCRs from 5.5% to 5.75% are reported. Given the low returns and resulting increased values, these assets have become very expensive to purchase and transaction activity is mostly limited to large investment pools such as pension funds and major REITs.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/10.png"></a>
The Product/Market Barometer chart suggests a downward trend in momentum ratio across nearly all markets. Similarly the Property Type Barometer chart for the current quarter indicates a downward trend, most notably among Tier 1 Regional Malls, from the previous quarter (3.2 buyers per seller in Q2 vs. 6.5 buyers per seller in Q1).
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=117"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/12.png"></a> <a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/11.png"></a>
The Historical Valuation Parameters for Tier 1 Regional Mall in Calgary suggests a flat IRR and slight increase in OCR and TCR from the previous quarter. The question that remains is whether a correction in retail is to follow or if it has reached a point of stability. 
</p>



<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Industrial properties remain highly ranked asset choices, with Multi-Tenant Industrial being ranked at first position in the Property Type Barometer shown in the Property Preferences section above. However, a notable change is that Single Tenant Industrial has moved down to sixth position. This can be attributed to the challenge of leasing large space to a single tenant, default risk and reduced demand from prospective owner-occupants.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/13.png"></a>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial continue to exhibit either stability or a downward trend in rates across all markets from the previous quarter. Rates at the upper end (7.2% to 7.7%) are observed in Montreal, Quebec City, and Halifax. In terms of IRRs, the range bandwidth appears to have narrowed a little this quarter in most markets. The exception is in Montreal and Quebec City, where the range for IRRs increased considerably, and the highest rate reported is 12.0%.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/14.png"></a>
Face rate growth for the next 12 months for Multi-Tenant Industrial are the highest in western markets and in Toronto (1.3% to 2.2%), although the optimism level varies considerably in these markets given the wider bandwidth observed in the chart on the right. In the eastern regions, only modest growth is anticipated in next 12 months (0.7% to 1.2%), and the respondents seem be agree given the narrower bandwidths. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=117"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/15.png"></a>
In terms of historical valuation parameters for Multi-Tenant Industrial in Toronto, the chart on the right suggests that rates of return dropped a bit from the previous quarter, resulting in increased values as indicated by increased $ Per Square Foot in Q2. The main drivers appear to be lower vacancy, security of income stream, ability to arrange financing at low interest rates and a modest rise in manufacturing activity, in spite of recent pessimistic reports on US recovery and retail sales. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and usually produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers, and low-cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. A notable change in Q2 is that this product has risen to second position in the product barometer, up from sixth position. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/16.png"></a>
However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be localized. In this survey, the strongest demand appears to be in Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, and Ottawa. The lowest demand is in Vancouver, Quebec City, and Halifax at 2.3 buyers for every seller. The explanation reflects two different market extremes of higher vacancy and low demand in Quebec City ($112,500 per suite) and top shelf pricing in Vancouver ($161,250 per suite). 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=117&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2011_Q2/17.png"></a>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 4.0% in Vancouver to 7.0% in Halifax and Montreal. One interesting pattern observed is that of IRR trends. The chart on the right shows a relatively large bandwidth for the IRR yields, notwithstanding relatively stable or declining averages. This suggests that investors remain slightly uncertain with overall risk for this asset and this further can be attributed to this asset being more highly leveraged and thus more prone to interest rate hikes and also to the wide range of this product in terms of quality and income potential. The low OCRs can be attributed to the fact that this asset class remained a "sought after" group throughout the recession and was subject to less yield decompression. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q2 2011 Investment Trends Survey confirms that the Canadian commercial property market continues to rebound to normalcy, though at a gradual and steady pace. Canada was insulated from the worst of global recession due in large part to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. However, "normal" means tightly held ownership, a lack of availability of quality product, deep pools of equity and active bidding for choice assets that infrequently become available. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the retail sector exhibits a cautionary stance from investors this quarter after a continuous stream of strong demand and increased valuations in past quarters. This does not imply that this sector is headed for trouble or values are expected to fall, but rather that the rate of return on these choice assets has moderated due to slow growth in retail sales. It may also indicate that retail product has reached a plateau and that investors are currently seeking out higher returns in the Office, Multi Unit Residential, and Multi-Tenant Industrial asset classes. 
</p>
