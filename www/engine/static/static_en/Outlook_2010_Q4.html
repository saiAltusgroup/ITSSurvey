<h2>Q4 2010 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q4 2010 Investment Trends Survey results confirm a sustained rebound in the Canadian commercial property market during 2010. Canada was largely insulated from the last global recession due in a large part to a stable, highly regulated banking system and an imposed discipline in the commercial real estate development sector. Respondents in this survey convey less caution compared to that being expressed in the financial or single family residential markets.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Investment Trends Survey confirms an orderly rebound in commercial market fundamentals and a high level of investor confidence. However, the commercial market is again moving into imbalance, due to a supply issue. Major property owners are highly motivated to buy because the Pension Funds, Life Companies and REITS are awash with cash and private investors once again have access to low cost mortgage money. The lack of listings is causing multiple bids for each asset, which has again fueled significant compression in OCRs and IRRs. As a result, in Q4 2010, reported yields for most asset classes have decreased to within 20bps to 40 bps of that experienced in the market peak in 2008/2009.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Canadian market has been disciplined during the last decade, resulting in limited distress properties and a fast recovery from the recession. While rental and income growth is projected to be modest, investors report that they are attracted to cash flow stability and low debt costs. The main perceived challenge is a lack of good quality properties to buy and a lack of new future supply in the pipeline. Our respondents in this survey predict that commercial real estate prices will be driven up, resulting in further yield compression. On a positive note, as vacancies abate and confidence grows, a new development cycle will get underway.

The location barometer summarizes the relative attractiveness of eight cities across Canada, as investment locations. This barometer measures the appeal of each city surveyed by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example in the most favoured centre, Vancouver, the 301 responses indicated an average of 2.3 buyers for every seller for all the property types reported in this survey. During 2010, Ottawa and Vancouver have swapped number one position, but have been favoured for different reasons. Ottawa has demonstrated a slow but stable economic performance, anchored by a high level of public sector employment. Vancouver on the other hand has a projected GDP in 2011 of 3.2% and attracts the lowest yields and highest prices, on a perennial basis, of all the cities surveyed. Toronto has maintained a close third position, but Calgary and Edmonton, benefitting from stronger oil prices, improved employment and more robust demand for commercial space, have regained momentum. Montreal remains in positive territory, but Quebec City and Halifax, being the smallest centres surveyed, are losing momentum on the barometer and report more of a balance between buyers and sellers.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H100&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/02.png"></a>
The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Montreal Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on trends for office assets. In our Q4 2009 survey, 74.2% of respondents were of the opinion that Montreal Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 3.2% that prices would increase. In the current survey, attitudes are far more positive, with only 3.1% of respondents (red) indicating that Montreal Class AA Office values would decrease and 43.8% were of the opinion that values would increase. The majority at 53.1% were of the opinion that values would remain stable. Even in the extremely competitive and overbuilt Downtown Calgary office market, 42.9% of respondents predict that Class AA Office values will increase and 45.4% predict "No Change" in prices.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/03.png"></a>
The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally is Tier I Regional Malls. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 35.0% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 63.5% project an increase during the next 12 months. The Investor Outlook survey points to the market moving from recovery to expansion phase and less than 5% of all respondents predict a decrease in prices. While the greatest weight of opinion is towards "No Change", there is a growing shift of opinion to "Increase"
</p>





<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Following a peak in required yields during the 2008 and early 2009 recession, our respondents currently indicate a very sharp trend in decreased yield requirements and increasing values. The replies in Q4 2010 indicate that 78.13% of respondents report that the required OCRs have decreased compared to the last quarter. In terms of required IRRs, 97% of respondents report a decrease in property yields, compared to three months ago. These results indicate that despite concerns over the European debt crisis and the impact of Canadian parity with the US dollar on exports, that demand for commercial real estate is surging and confidence rising. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/04.png"></a>
The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. What is noteworthy are the tighter "band widths" of opinion for Multiple Unit Residential and, in this survey, wider spreads and greater divergence of opinion for Tier I Regional Malls.
</p>

<p>
The lowest "going in" yields continue to appear in the Multi Unit Residential sector, reported in the 4.5% to 7.0% range, this being 10 bps to 30 bps less than 6 months ago. Respondents are now expressing a higher level of confidence with only 3.13% of replies suggesting that OCRs have increased for the prime products surveyed during the last 3 months.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/05.png"></a>
In terms of IRRs our respondents overwhelmingly endorse a decrease in yield expectations for prime real estate. In this survey, only one out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required in IRRs and 31 reported a decrease since the last quarter's survey. These results support a strong statement of a shift from recovery cycle to expansion cycle in the commercial real estate market.
</p>




<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/06.png"></a>
The current Property Type Barometer indicates that momentum shifts are uneven and mirror the "bumpy" nature of the recovery cycle. For example, the market's top preference, Tier I Regional Malls, reports 6.2 buyers for every seller, down from 8.9 buyers in the previous survey. Food Anchored Retail and Power Centres are also top preferences, underscoring the strong level of demand for retail properties. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential, with 3.7 buyers for every seller, has negative momentum and has moved down to number five position. Multi-Tenant Industrial has gained in popularity with 3.6 buyers for every seller. Downtown Class "A" Office is another top ten pick that is gaining momentum. Despite the positive responses for prime properties, secondary assets continue to receive bearish sentiment, with Suburban Class "B" Office and Enclosed Community Malls being reported as the least preferred assets. Interestingly, while still in negative territory, Hotels and Suburban Office Land are gaining positive momentum. In this report, Downtown Land and Industrial Land have moved back into vogue, heralding the start of a new development cycle.
</p>



<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/07.png"></a>
The demand for Downtown Class "AA" Office investments continues to gain strength, on the heels of positive absorption in the overbuilt Toronto and Calgary markets. Both markets continue to experience a "flight to quality" in 2010 by such tenants as financial institutions in Toronto. In tandem, energy companies in Calgary have leased new office space or absorbed sub-lease space from the market. Tenants have been attracted to competitive rental rates and generous inducement packages. The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Toronto market. The market experienced a sustained bull run from Q4 2001 (8.4% OCR) to Q3 2007 (5.7%), then retreated until Q3 2009 (7.0%) and has recovered to an average OCR of 6.1% in Q4 2010. This demonstrates an astounding 70 bps rebound in 2010, positioning this asset class within 40 bps of the price peak in Q3 2007. This is partly explained by an imbalance between demand and supply. The supply pipeline is unable to deliver sufficient quantity of new product to match the heightened demand and buyer appetite, buoyed by large volume of cash and /or low interest debt. Existing owners continue to hold, rather than sell, prime assets because they have become virtually irreplaceable.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R200&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=1&amp;property_0=3"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/08.png"></a>
Another sign of recovery is the "bottoming out" of net effective rents for Class "AA" office space. A review of the net effective rents in the Toronto Downtown Class "AA" market is presented on the slide opposite. Average reported net effective rents hit bottom in Q3 2010, at $21.06 per sq ft, rising to $22.05 per sq ft in Q4. This compares to the previous high of $25.90 per sq ft in Q4 2007, 36 months ago. The net effective rents for Class "AA" office space in the Vancouver market also reported an increase to $25.08 in this survey, but it is noteworthy that Downtown Calgary also increased from $20.83 in Q3 to $21.73 per sq ft in Q4 2010.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H400&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/09.png"></a>
Our Q4 retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Tier II Regional Malls and Enclosed Community Malls. Respondents report that the retail investment market is strengthening with a high level of buyer confidence, resulting in increased values and decreased yields. However, buyers remain selective and investment demand for retail fluctuates according to quality. For example, in the favoured Vancouver market, there are currently 7.3 buyers for every seller for a Tier I Regional Mall, compared to 2.4 buyers for every seller for a Tier II Regional Mall in locations across BC. On the other hand, there are 1.2 sellers for every buyer in Vancouver for the less favoured and lower quality Enclosed Community Mall.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/10.png"></a>
The graph on the right highlights the fortunes of Tier I Regional Malls. The market peaked in Q3 2007 with a 5.4% OCR and gradually climbed to 6.5% in Q2 2009, a yield that has now rebounded in Q4 2010 to 5.6%, just 20 bps off its market peak.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/11.png"></a>
Tier II Regional Malls have also rebounded in popularity and are now in seventh position on the product barometer. The current yield expectations are illustrated on the graph opposite. Currently, OCRs range from 6.6% to 7.2% in Western Canada and 7.1% to 7.5% in Eastern Canada, a 60 to 80 bps improvement during the last 12 months.
Enclosed Community Malls are viewed less favourably, with OCRs at 10 to 40 bps above Tier II Malls with reported yields in the 6.7% (Vancouver) to 7.9% (Halifax) range.
</p>





<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=12"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/12.png"></a>
Industrial properties remain highly ranked asset choices, with Multi-Tenant Industrial being ranked in third position on the product barometer and Single-Tenant Industrial being less regarded at number eight. Both product types have experienced a compression in required yields, despite only modest potential for rental increases. The highest growth in rental face rates are in Quebec City with 1.0% growth during the next 12 months. The 2-3 year outlook for face rate growth is more positive in the 2.0% to 2.5% per annum range, except for Quebec locations in the 0.9% to 1.9% range.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/13.png"></a>
The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant Industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single-Tenant Industrial range from 6.4% (Vancouver) to 8.1% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations, which have been less prone to the meltdown in the key manufacturing sector. During the last 12 month period, the majority of locations have improved in value and experienced a decrease in required OCRs of 30 bps (Quebec City) to 100 bps (Ottawa). The compression in OCRs has been more pronounced in western locations, which have benefitted from a stronger rebound in employment, following resurgence in demand in the resources sector.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=3&amp;property_1=12&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/14.png"></a>
In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Multi Tenant Industrial range from 6.5% (Vancouver) to 8.3% (Quebec City) and again, tend to be stronger in western locations. During the last 12 month period, the majority of locations have improved in value. In Calgary, which was heavily impacted by the downturn in oil prices during the recession, the industrial market has rebounded. OCRs for Multi-Tenant Industrial reached 7.9% in Q4 2009 and now sits at 7.1%, despite predictions for only modest rental growth. The main driver appears to be low vacancy, security of income stream, ability to arrange financing at low interest rates and robust demand, with listings attracting multiple offers.
</p>




<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S102&amp;period=115"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/15.png"></a>
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. This asset type has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. Despite recessionary conditions experienced in 2008 and 2009, vacancy rates remained low and have improved during the last 12 months in all provinces except Quebec and Saskatchewan. In the Q4 2010 survey, respondents were asked to rank the Motivation for Multi Residential Investment. The primary motivation, attracting a 92.1% response, was Stability of Income, followed by Debt Costs (86.8%) and Stability of Value versus Other Asset Types (45%). Interestingly, the lowest ranking was given to Capital Growth and Income Growth.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/16.png"></a>
However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be localized. In this survey, the strongest demand appears to be in Toronto, with 8.5 buyers for every seller and Ottawa at 6.0 buyers. The lowest demand emanates from the coastal cities of Halifax at 1.2 buyers and Vancouver at 1.3 buyers for every seller. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=115&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q4/17.png"></a>
The reported yield in terms of OCRs for Suburban Multi Residential ranges from a low of 5.1% in Vancouver to 6.7% in Halifax. This investment type has demonstrated less of an increase in value, as a result of less yield compression than other product types surveyed. Therefore during the last 12 months, reported OCRs are only 10 to 40 bps lower than those reported in Q4 2009. This is partly explained by the fact that multiple residential remained a "sought after" asset class throughout the recession and was subject to less decompression.
</p>



<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q4 2010 Investment Trends Survey confirms a sustained rebound in the Canadian commercial property market. Respondents in this survey convey less caution compared to that being expressed in the financial or single family residential markets.
