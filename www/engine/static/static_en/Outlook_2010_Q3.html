<h2>Q3 2010 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q3 2010 Investment Trends Survey reports that the Canadian commercial real estate market is well into a sustained recovery cycle. Overall, the survey results reflect strong buyer interest in the retail and multi family sectors and a steady level of demand for properties in the industrial and office markets. The recovery in demand and appetite for commercial real estate from private buyers and REITS has been impressive and has resulted in steady yield compression during the last 12 months. Heightened activity has been encouraged by low bond yields translated into low mortgage interest rates and an improved supply of debt. Increased values have narrowed the previous vendor purchaser pricing gap and motivated vendors to consummate deals.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
As an "imperfect" market, the commercial real estate sector has historically lagged changes occurring in other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock and single family housing markets. Recently, in response to concerns over international debt levels and a faltering USA economy, the Canadian stock market has dipped and economic recovery and new job creation has been weaker than expected. Despite signs of a stall in the recovery curve, the commercial real estate investment market is benefitting from strong fundamentals, motivated buyers with a surplus of cash; good availability of debt at very attractive rates and strong buyer interest. The main perceived challenge is a lack of good quality properties to buy and a lack of new future supply in the pipeline.

The location barometer summarizes the relative attractiveness of eight cities across Canada as investment locations. This barometer measures the appeal of each city surveyed by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example in the leading centre Ottawa, the 331 responses indicated an average of 2.3 buyers for every seller for all the property types surveyed. The location barometer indicates that, since Q2 2010, sentiment has become slightly more ‘bullish’ in Edmonton, Halifax and Montreal; remained the same in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver and turned more ‘bearish’ in Calgary and Quebec City. The slow changes in momentum during the last 12 months have mirrored the gradual pace of economic recovery forecast by Altus Group’s economists.

In our Q3 2009 survey, 42.4 % of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 9.1 % that prices would increase. In the current survey, attitudes are far more positive, with only 10.3 % of respondents (red) indicating that Toronto Class AA Office values would decrease and 33.3 % were of the opinion that values would increase. The majority at 56.4 % were of the opinion that values would remain stable. Even in the extremely competitive and overbuilt Downtown Calgary office market, 23.5 % of respondents predict that Class AA Office values will increase and 55.9 % predict no change in prices.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=114&amp;product_0=4&amp;property_0=19"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/03.gif"></a>
The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally is Downtown Multiple Residential. The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 45.6 % of respondents forecast stability in prices and 54.4 %  project an increase during the next 12 months. For the first time in the history of the survey, the respondents were unanimous in the opinion that values for Downtown Multiple Family would not decrease during the next 12 months. The overall Investor Outlook survey reflects confident optimism, with less than 10% of all respondents predicting that prices will decrease and in most product types, the greatest weight of opinion is towards "No Change" in values.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>
<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S305&amp;period=114"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/04.gif"></a>Following a peak in required yields and a "bottoming" of values at the depth of the recession 2008 and early 2009, our respondents indicate stability in yield requirements and values. The replies in Q3 2010 indicate that 59.4 % of respondents conclude that the required OCRs and IRRs are the same compared to last quarter.  These results underscore the slow nature of economic recovery, but may also provide the first hint, that the stalling economy may also impact the rebound in the commercial real estate market.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. What is noteworthy is the narrower "band widths" of opinion for Multiple Unit Residential and Single Tenant Industrial, and wider spreads and greater uncertainty for Downtown Class "AA" Office.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
The lowest "going in" yields continue to predominate in the Multi Residential sector in the 5.3% to 6.9% range, this being 10 to 20 bps less than 6 months ago. Despite improving results, respondents are still expressing some caution, in that in 9.4 % of the product/location choices, OCRs are indicated to increase.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S306&amp;period=114"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/05.gif"></a>In terms of IRRs our respondents appear to generally report stability in yield expectations for prime real estate. In this survey, six out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required IRRs, a total of 7 respondents reported a decrease and 59.4% reported no change since the last quarter’s survey.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=114&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/06.gif"></a>The current Property Type Barometer indicates that momentum shifts are uneven and mirror the "bumpy" nature of the recovery cycle. For example, the market’s top preference, Tier I Regional Malls, reports 8.9 buyers for every seller, up from 6.2 buyers in the previous survey. Food Anchored Retail and Power Centres are also top preferences, underscoring the strong level of demand for retail properties. Suburban Multiple Unit Residential with 3.7 buyers for every seller also has positive momentum and has moved up to number four position. Single Tenant and Multi-Tenant Industrial have slipped in popularity with only 2.5 to 2.8 buyers for every seller. Downtown Class "A" Office and Tier II Regional Malls remain top ten picks, but are losing momentum. Under the current climate, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Suburban Class "B" Office, Hotels, and Suburban Office and Industrial Land, being reported as the least preferred assets. Suburban Class "B" Office continues to be the least desired asset class with 2.6 sellers for every buyer.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Downtown Class "AA" Office investments have rebounded surprisingly, given the overhang of new space in Calgary and Toronto. Both markets experienced a "flight to quality" in 2010 by tenants such as financial companies in Toronto and energy companies in Calgary, who leased new space or withdrew sub-lease space from the market. Tenants were attracted to competitive rental rates and generous inducement packages. The investment trend for Downtown Class "AA" Office is illustrated on the slide opposite in respect of the Toronto market.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=114"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/07.gif"></a>The market experienced a sustained "bull market" run from Q4 2001 (8.4% OCR) to Q3 2007 (5.7% OCR), then under recessionary conditions, retracted until Q3 2009 (7.0%). After hitting bottom, it has recovered to 6.5% OCR in Q3 2010. What is clear is that the rebound in yields is influenced by low cost debt and the yields required in the office investment market will be sensitive to future increases in interest rates.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=114&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=5"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/08.gif"></a>The results for Class "A" Suburban Office supports the notion of a steady market recovery. In the Q3 2010 survey, OCRs for Class "A" Suburban Office had decreased by 40 to 70 bps from the last survey, 12 months ago. The most dramatic decreases were in Toronto and Ottawa (60 bps) and Quebec City (70 bps). In this survey, OCRs range from 7.4% to 8.0%, with the exception of Vancouver at 6.8%. The IRRs for Suburban Class "A" Office are in the range of 8.6 % to 8.9% in all centres except Vancouver, which remains at 8.1%. The compression in OCRs for Class "A" Suburban Office is illustrated by the recent sale of a 163,000 sq ft new office building located at 110 Quarry Park Boulevard in Calgary. This fully leased contemporary property sold at around 7.0% OCR and was purchased from the developer by a life company.

The opportunity for initial return was ranked second and capital appreciation came third, followed closely by availability and low cost of debt/equity.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=114&amp;product_0=2&amp;property_0=11,9,10,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/10.gif"></a>Our Q3 retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Single Tenant Retail, Food Anchored Retail Strip and Power Centres. Retail product has demonstrated a significant recovery in values and yield requirement, with OCRs required decreasing by 30 to 100 bps across the country. Retail investments command the top three positions on the product barometer and have attracted healthy interest from buyers. In Ottawa, there are currently 4.7 buyers for every seller for retail products, compared to 3.4 buyers at the beginning of the year.

The market in Montreal peaked in Q1 2007 at a 5.8% OCR and gradually climbed to 7.3 % in Q3 2009, at the depth of the recession. OCRs have since recovered to 6.7% in Q3 2010.

The current yield expectations are illustrated on the graph opposite. Currently, OCRs range from 6.5% to 7.2% in Western Canada; 7.1% to 7.2% in Ontario and 7.5% to 7.7% in Quebec. Halifax consistently requires higher yields in all retail categories and is reported at 8.1% OCR for Food Anchored Strips. Tier I Regional Malls are still regarded as the premium investment type, with OCRs at 60 to 110 bps less than Food Anchored Retail Strips.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=114&amp;product_0=3&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/13.gif"></a>Industrial properties remain top ten asset choices, but are still prone to the impact of softer demand, vacancy and competition. As a result, respondents conclude that, in some locations there is downward pressure on rental rates and, at best, only modest potential for rental increases. The question asked of respondents was what the current net face rate was for a single tenant building leased to a new tenant for a 10 year term. Rents in Western Canada are projected to be between $7.10 and $7.50 per sq ft for the first 5 years of the term, unchanged from the last survey. However, the rents for the second 5 years showed a decrease from the last survey. Softer rents were expressed for Toronto and Montreal in the $5.50 per sq ft range for the first 5 years of the term and a downward momentum for the second 5 years of the term. This is not unexpected considering the loss of manufacturing employment during the recession in central Canada.

In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial range from 6.6% (Vancouver) to 8.2% (Halifax) and tend to be stronger in western locations. During the last 12 months, the majority of locations have improved in value, having experienced a decrease in required OCRs of 40 to 60 bps. In terms of Outlook, 21.6 % of respondents believe that Single Tenant Industrial values will increase during the next 12 months versus 5.9%, who forecast a decrease.

During the last 12 months, the majority of locations have improved in value. In Calgary, the OCR range is from 7.0% to 8.3% and the IRR range from 8.0% to 9.3%. This is closely supported by the recent sale of the 309,000 sq ft Hopewell Airport Park office warehouse complex in Calgary for $31.3 million and demonstrating an OCR in the range of 7.40% and an IRR in the range of 8.0%. This is a modern three building complex built in 2008 and located on land leased from the Calgary Airport Authority.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?format=0&amp;step=2&amp;report_2=S200&amp;period=114"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q3/16.gif"></a>This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Multiple Unit Residential has benefitted from a slowdown in the home ownership market, increased employment numbers and low cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. In the Q3 2010 survey, respondents were asked to rank Threats to Multi Residential Investment. The major threat, attracting a 61.6% response was Unexpected Capital Costs, which for multiple residential properties is a non recoverable expense item. This was followed by Debt Costs (50%) and Energy Costs (45%). Interestingly, despite increased vacancy in multiple Residential in some markets, the lowest ranking was given to Vacancy/Availability.

<p style="clear:both;">

In Q3 2009, the strongest demand was in the Montreal market with 12.0 buyers for every seller, followed by Ottawa with 11.0 buyers for every seller. In this survey, Ottawa remains a favoured location at 11.0 buyers and Calgary has moved up in the rankings to 9.0 buyers for every seller. Montreal slipped to number 4 position with 5.0 buyers for every seller. Unlike the last quarter, all markets are in positive territory with positive demand demonstrated by there being more buyers than sellers.

This investment type has improved during the last 12 months, with OCRs being 20 to 60 bps lower than those reported in Q3 2009.
The results for Suburban Multiple Residential are similar with OCRs in the 5.3% to 6.9% range. Recently in Ottawa, the 117 unit "high end" Terrasses Gabrielle sold at $280,000 per unit and an OCR of 5.6%, slightly below the survey average of 5.9%, but not unexpected given its high quality.
