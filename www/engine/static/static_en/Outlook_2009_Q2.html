<h2>Q2 2009 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
After an 18 month downward slide in the commercial property market, our Q2 2009 Investment Trends Survey reports weak signs of a possible return to stability. The survey results mirror the early signs of recovery demonstrated by some other sectors of the economy, such as oil prices, stock market indices and single family housing statistics. However economists warn that unemployment is deepening and manufacturing performance is still weak, resulting in a slow choppy recovery. So, can it be concluded the mild opportunism reported in this survey may be a "false" bottom or the first phase of a "double dip"? The rebound in the commercial real estate sector traditionally lags a rebound in the rest of the economy. Forecasting is difficult at best and subsequent surveys will provide the answers as to whether this is the start of a rebound or a fleeting blip in a recovery cycle.

The Q2 2009 Investment Trends Survey certainly reflects a stabilization in the yield requirements for prime retail, office and multi family assets, and mixed signals for industrial real estate. The Location Barometer shown on the right indicates a shift to bullish demand, (more buyers than sellers) in three locations, namely Ottawa, Vancouver and Toronto. Positive momentum is reported in all other locations except Halifax. Ottawa remains the top investment choice, with 1.7 buyers for every seller, compared to the least favoured choices of Calgary and Halifax with 1.5 sellers for every buyer. Momentum indicators remain extremely weak, with shallow demand (few buyers) and shallow supply (few sellers). In Ottawa, the location barometer indicated one buyer for every seller and in Calgary and Halifax, at number six and seven position respectively, there are 1.5 sellers for every buyer. Montreal, Quebec City and Edmonton are slightly bearish but stable.

The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Toronto Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on property price trends for first class assets. In our Q1 2009 survey, 81.8% of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 18.2 % indicated values would remain stable during the next 12 months. In the current survey, attitudes are more bullish, with only 44.7% of respondents (red) indicating that Toronto Class AA Office values would decrease and 39.5% of respondents anticipating no change (orange). The most positive response is that in Q2 2009, 15.8% are of the opinion that Toronto Class AA Downtown values will increase, versus 0.0% in the previous quarter.

<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R100&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=7&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/02.gif"></a>
The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally was Tier I Regional Malls, and even then, the Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 38.1% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 53.4% predicted that prices will decrease during the next 12 months. It is clear that, although yields have stabilized, the majority of our respondents are of the opinion that values will continue to erode during the next 12 months.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S305&amp;period=109&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/04.gif"></a>
Following nearly 2 years of market erosion, investor yield expectations for prime assets in Canadian commercial property investment market respondents indicate signs of stability. The replies to the survey in Q2 2009 indicate that 75% of responses conclude that the required OCRs are the same or less compared to the previous quarter and 66% of reported IRRs are the same or less. In light of improving economic conditions, does this represent the bottom of the downward spiral or a just a temporary spring breather? Have market participants reached a comfort level with reported yields or does the market await much needed empirical support from a stronger sampling of transactional evidence?
</p>

<p>
The graph of OCR yields compares different classes of assets in locations across Canada. A continuing pattern is that the lowest yields and highest prices are reported for Vancouver and the highest yields in terms of OCRs are reported in the smaller markets of Quebec City and Halifax. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_2=S306&amp;period=109&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/05.gif"></a>
The lowest "Going In" yields continue to predominate in the Multi Residential sector in the 5.4% to 7.5% range. Despite these positive results, investors are still expressing some caution, with 25% of product/location OCRs indicating an increase over the previous quarter.
</p>

<p>
In terms of IRRs our respondents appear to report stability or bottoming out for prime real estate. In this survey, only 7 out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required IRRs, a total of 7 reported an decrease, and 18 or 56% reported no change since the last quarter. Yields in the secondary markets are not tracked as regularly, but will be more severely impacted by softening demand. In markets where debt is extremely scarce, they typically attract leveraged buyers, particularly for secondary assets. 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R402&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/06.gif"></a>
The market's top preferences are for Tier I Regional Malls and Food Anchored Retail, as illustrated on the graph to the right, with 4.5 buyers for every seller. Positive momentum and improving demand is being reported for other previously sought-after asset types, such as Multiple Unit Residential, Multi-Tenant Industrial and Downtown Class "A" Office. As recessionary conditions continue and credit remains tight, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Suburban Office Land, Suburban Class B Office and Community Malls being reported as less preferred assets. Hotels are the least desired asset class on the Property Type Barometer, with 7.4 sellers for every buyer. This is a significant downward shift from 4.8 buyers reported in the Q1 2009 survey.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R500&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=3,4,5,6&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/07.gif"></a>
The Office Vacancy Outlook influences investors' appetite for this property class and the respondents report that office vacancy will increase in all categories during the next three months. While the vacancy outlook is negative for all markets, Ottawa, Quebec City, Toronto and Vancouver Suburban Office are reporting a positive shift in momentum (less increase than previously reported). The categories which attract the strongest negative sentiment are - not surprisingly &amp;emdash; Toronto, Calgary Downtown Class "A" and Class "B" product in Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto and Montreal. Class "B" office appears to have the greatest exposure, as tenants are attracted to softening rents in Class "A" building in a flight to better quality space.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H101&amp;product_1=1&amp;property_1=3&amp;market_1=4&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=109&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/08.gif"></a>
The historical Valuation Parameters graph for Toronto Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the Canadian market for prime office investments for the last 9 years. A 6 year bull run cycled out in Q3 2007, and then - in response to the recession - yield requirements climbed for the next 18 months. Surprisingly, required yields for Toronto Downtown Class "A" Office have stabilized during the first two quarters of 2009, with OCRs at 7.0%, TCRs 40 bps higher and IRRs at 8.3%. The notion that this market has "bottomed out" is strongly endorsed by recent sales activity in the downtown Vancouver office market. During 2009, a total of 1.2 million sq ft of downtown office space, located in 6 buildings, has sold for over $500 million at a weighted average yield of 7.85% IRR. The Investor Outlook for Vancouver Downtown Class "AA" Office is very positive with 17.2% of respondents anticipating values to increase and 69% reporting "no change" or stability.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=4&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/09.gif"></a>
The reports for Class "B" Downtown Office are less encouraging, as this asset class gets buffeted by recessionary conditions. The OCRs have increased to the 8.1% to 8.5% range in all locations except in the higher performing Vancouver market, which reports 7.3%. The IRRs for Class "B" Office are in the range of 9.0% to 9.5%, except for Ottawa at 8.8% and Vancouver at 8.5%. This asset type is difficult to finance and is prone to increasing vacancy and declining rents. It therefore attracts the most negative response from the Investor Outlook portion of the survey. A total of 61% of respondents are of the opinion that Class "B" Office values will decline during the next 12 months and vacancy will &amp;emdash; on average &amp;emdash; increase by 3.65% and up to 8.1% in Calgary. 
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H402&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=7&amp;market_1=6&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=109&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/10.gif"></a>
Our Q2 retail survey included Tier I and Tier II Regional Malls and Community Malls. Respondents reported the retail investment market reaching some semblance of stability expressed in terms of a slight bullish shift on the barometer, and a pause in the upward shift in yield requirements. The graph on the right highlights the fortunes of Tier I Regional Malls. The market peaked in Q2 2007 at a 5.7% OCR and gradually climbed to 7.0% in Q2 2009, only 10 bps higher than the previous quarter. On a positive note, nationally, Tier I Regional Malls have rebounded on the property barometer to number one position, with 4.5 buyers for every seller
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=8&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/11.gif"></a>
The market meltdown is highlighted by the shift in yield expectations for Tier II Malls, illustrated on the graph opposite. For Tier II malls located in the western provinces of BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan, OCR yields increased by 30 to 40 bps since Q4 2008, catching up to OCRs in the more distressed eastern markets, where yields had shifted earlier. Currently, OCRs range from 7.3% to 8.5% and IRRs from 8.7% to 10.1%. This product type has been hit by shrinking consumer spending and the extreme difficulty encountered by owners in securing financing. The "poor cousin" of our retail survey, the Enclosed Community Mall, reported OCRs of 7.5% in Vancouver up to 8.9% in Halifax. The Investor Outlook for Enclosed Community Malls somewhat parallels other secondary assets and remains bleak, with 58.3% of respondents predicting that values will decrease during the next 12 months and only 2.8% anticipating that values will increase.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R300&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=12&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/12.gif"></a>
Single and Multi Tenant Industrial properties remain top ranked asset choices, but are still prone to the impact of vacancy, plant closures and reduced shipping requirements during tougher economic times. As a result, respondents concluded that, during the next 12 months, rental rates for Multi Tenant Industrial will drop by 1.1% in Vancouver, up to 3.3% in Quebec City.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R101&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/13.gif"></a>
The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial range from 7.0% (Vancouver) to 8.4% (Halifax) and tend to be stronger in western locations, which have been less prone to the meltdown in the key manufacturing sector. The Toronto OCR of 7.8% is showing signs of stability, having increased only 10 bps since Q1 2009 and having previously increased 70bps over the last 6 months. In terms of Outlook, only 3.7% of respondents believe that Multi Tenant Industrial values will increase during the next 12 months, versus 44.7% who forecast a decrease. It can be concluded that, while yields have stabilized somewhat, respondents anticipate a fall in asset cash flow performance during the next 12 months.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Suburban Multiple Unit Residential - Apartments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_0=R404&amp;period=109&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15&amp;market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/14.gif"></a>
This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation "Y" cohort produces stable vacancies and stable cash flows. However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be strongly localized. The strongest demand is in the Ontario market with 8.5 buyers for every seller in Toronto and 10.0 in Ottawa. Demand is positive, but generally weaker in the west, with Edmonton at 1 buyer per seller and Vancouver at 4.0 buyers for every seller.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?report_1=H101&amp;product_1=4&amp;property_1=15&amp;market_1=3&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=109&amp;step=2"><img hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2009_Q2/15.gif"></a>
The graph on the right summarizes the historic valuation parameters for Calgary for this asset type. The market - as expressed by yield requirements - peaked in Calgary in Q4 2007 at 5.3% OCR and increased steadily to the current rate of 6.3%. During the last 6 months, Calgary has experienced the same stability in required yields as Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax. Toronto and Vancouver report a slight decline in required OCRs at 6.6% and 5.4%, respectively. The Multi Residential market appears to be searching for a point of stability, as indicated by divergent investor views on both yields and unit values.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
In summary, the Canadian commercial property market is searching for the bottom of an 18 to 24 month recessionary cycle. For prime assets, while yield requirements have stabilized and momentum is in a positive direction, recovery is still a distant prospect. Downward vacancy and rental expectations result in the majority opinion that values are stable or declining. An average of 47% of respondents believe that the values of prime retail, office, industrial and multi family product will decline during the next 12 months. Interestingly, 46% express the opinion that values will remain the same. Are we at the turning point in the downward cycle or are investors taking a temporary breather? The shape and timing of the recovery is hinged on a return of consumer spending and confidence in the USA and stability in domestic interest rates. The position in the cycle is very uncertain and not helped by the lack of property sales evidence. The economic recovery for commercial real estate over the next 12 months is bound to be both choppy and ragged.
