<h2>Q1 2010 Outlook</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2010 Investment Trends Survey reports improving conditions and growing investor confidence in the Canadian commercial real estate market. Overall, the survey results reflect strengthening interest in the retail sector, continued support for the Industrial and Multi Family sectors and caution in the Office market. The recovery curve is firming, but still bumpy, because both buyer and seller attitudes shift gradually, responding to improvements in liquidity and availability of financing. While interest rates remain attractively low, lending terms and availability are still spotty and very borrower/product specific.
</p>

<p>
The commercial real estate market is experiencing a slower more cautious recovery compared to other sectors of the economy, particularly the stock market and single family housing sector. On a bright note, REITs are making good progress in re-financing and raising capital and have re-emerged as buyers. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads are encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors in check. Unlike the USA, the Canadian market has not seen the same volume of distress opportunities at discounted prices, although the office sector in some locations and secondary product in less prime locations are showing selective signs of stress. The "jobless recovery" in the economy continues to impact demand for space in the office and industrial sectors, while softer demand for exports from south of the border continues to discourage the manufacturing sector.

The Location Barometer on the right summarizes the relative attractiveness of eight cities across Canada as investment locations. This barometer measures the appeal of each city surveyed by comparing the number of buyers to the number of sellers. For example in the leading centre, Vancouver, the 356 responses indicated an average of 2.3 buyers for every seller for all the property types surveyed. The Location Barometer indicates a "sea change" from 12 months ago, when all locations except Ottawa were in negative territory, with more sellers than buyers. Calgary and Edmonton in particular were not in vogue. In the Q1 2010 survey, respondents expressed bullish responses for real estate investment in all of Canada's major cities. However, during this period of recovery, momentum was not unexpectedly flat everywhere, except in Toronto, Quebec City and Calgary. The greatest improvement was reported in Calgary, with a shift from 1.2 sellers for every buyer to 1.1 buyers for every seller. Ottawa remains in second position and Quebec City has ascended to number 4 position, eclipsing Montreal for the first time in survey history.

The Investor Outlook Graph on the right, in respect of Toronto Downtown Class AA Office mirrors the national Outlook on trends for office assets. In our Q1 2009 survey, 81.8 % of respondents were of the opinion that Toronto Downtown Class AA Office prices would decrease and 0 % that prices would increase. In the current survey, attitudes are far more positive, with only 24.4 % of respondents (red) indicating that Toronto Class AA Office values would decrease and 31.7 % were of the opinion that values would increase. The majority at 43.9% were of the opinion that values would remain stable. This contrasts sharply with the depressed Downtown Calgary office market, where 50% of respondents predict that Class AA Office values will decline and 43.8% predict stability.

The product attracting the greatest confidence nationally is Tier I Regional Malls.The Investor Outlook results shown on the right indicate that 50.5% of respondents forecast stability in prices and 45.1 % (up from 33.3% in Q4 2009) predict increase during the next 12 months. The greatest caution in the Investor Outlook is expressed for Single Tenant Industrial, with 19.2 % of respondents predicting that values will fall during the next 12 months. However, this is an improvement over the previous quarter when 32.5% of respondents felt that values for Single Tenant Industrial would decline.
</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;">Investment Yields</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
Following a decline in market values in 2008 and early 2009, our respondents indicate continuing signs of a decline in yield requirements and a corresponding increase in values. The replies in Q1 2010 indicate that 84 % of respondents conclude that the required OCRs are the same or less compared to the last quarter and 94% report that IRRs are the same or less. There are encouraging signs that the commercial market is catching up with other economic sectors and investors are becoming more bullish about investment yields.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">

The graph of OCR yields compares different types of assets in locations across Canada. There is less uncertainty, being expressed in a narrowing of "band widths" of opinion down to less than 200 bps spread for each product type. The lowest "going in" yields continue to predominate in the Multi Residential sector in the 5.4% to 7.2% range, this being 10 to 40 bps less than 12 months ago. Despite improving results, respondents are still expressing some caution, in that in 7 % of the product/location choices, OCRs are indicated to increase.
<p>
In terms of IRRs our respondents appear to report stability or bottoming out for prime real estate. In this survey, only two out of 32 product/location combinations reported an increase in required IRRs, a total of 23 respondents reported a decrease and 7 reported no change since the last quarter's survey. 
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Property Preferences</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R402&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=11,3,4,1,9,16,14,12,10,0,13,5,6,15,2,7,8"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/06.gif"></a>
The current Property Type Barometer indicates that momentum shifts are uneven and mirror the "bumpy" nature of the recovery cycle. For example, the market's top preference, Tier I Regional Malls, reports 8.0 buyers for every seller, up from 6.5 buyers in the previous survey. Food Anchored Retail and Single Tenant Industrial have positive momentum but Multi-Tenant Industrial has slipped in popularity with only 2.7 buyers per every seller. Downtown Class "A" Office, Power Centres and Tier II Regional Malls remain top ten picks, but are losing momentum. Under the current climate, secondary assets and land continue to receive bearish indications with Suburban Class "B" Office, Hotels, Suburban Office and Industrial Land being reported as the least preferred assets. Community Malls, the least desired asset class on the Property Type Barometer for many years, has stabilized in the standings with 1.6 sellers for every buyer, (compared to 2.3 sellers reported in the Q3 2009 survey).
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Office Investments</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=20"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/07.gif"></a>
In Q1 of each year, the survey includes opinions on Class "AA" Downtown Office Leasehold Valuation Parameters. The range of OCRs required for Class "AA" Leasehold Office is from 6.5% to 7.8%, representing a premium of 10 bps (Halifax) to 40 bps (Ottawa) over the Q1 2010 rates for Freehold Class "AA" properties. The average spread across the country, between Leasehold and Freehold required yield rates, is in the range of 30 bps. The investment results for Freehold Class "AA" Office have improved to indicate a range of OCRs of 6.2% to 7.7% and IRRs of 7.6% to 8.8%.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R100&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=20"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/08.gif"></a>
In terms of demand, Leasehold Class "AA" assets have paralleled Freehold investments, as shown on the graph opposite. At the market peak in Q1 2007, 75 % of respondents were of the opinion that Values for Leasehold Class AA Office would increase in value, whereas by Q1 2009, 75% felt that values would decline. Twelve months later, in this survey, 22.6 % of respondents believe that values will increase, 22.6% are of the opinion that values will decrease and 54.8% have voted for stable prices.
</p>

<p>
The results for Class "B" Suburban Office supports the notion that the market is recovering, even for "second tier" investments.(Slide 9 Valuation Parameters Suburban Class B Office) In the Q1 2009 survey, OCRs for Class "B" Suburban Office had increased by 70 to 150 bps from the last survey, 12 months ago. The most dramatic increases were in Toronto (120 bps) and Calgary (150 bps). In this survey, a market rebound is evident, with OCRs improving by 10 bps (Halifax) up to 60 bps (Montreal). The one exception is Calgary where suburban vacancies remain in the 15% range and OCRs are unchanged at 8.1%. The IRRs for Suburban Class "B" Office are in the range of 9.0 % to 9.5% in all cities except Vancouver, which remains at 8.3%.

<h2 style="clear:both;">Retail</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R403&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=7"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/09.gif"></a>

Our Q1 retail survey included Tier I Regional Malls, Food Anchored Retail Strip and Power Centres. Respondents report that the retail investment market is strengthening with a bullish shift reported on the barometer and an improvement in yield requirements. In Montreal, there are currently 16.0 buyers for every seller for a Tier I Regional Mall, compared to 5.7 buyers for every seller 12 months ago The graph on the right highlights the fortunes of Tier I Regional Malls. The market peaked in Q3 2007 at a 5.4% OCR and gradually climbed to 6.5 % in Q2 2009, a yield that has now improved to 6.2% in Q1 2010. 
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?step=2&amp;report_1=H101&amp;product_1=2&amp;property_1=9&amp;market_1=1&amp;histlen=0&amp;period=112"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/11.gif"></a>
Food Anchored Retail Strips have also rebounded in popularity, reaching number two position on the product barometer. The current yield expectations are illustrated on the graph opposite. Currently, OCRs range from 6.7% to 7.1% in Western Canada and 7.3% to 8.1% in Eastern Canada. For example, the 77,314 sq ft Whitby Shores Centre located in Whitby Ontario closed in January 2010 for $17.3 million or about 7.4 % OCR and 8.0 % IRR.
Power Centres are still viewed slightly more favorably, with OCRs at 10 to 30 bps less than Food Anchored Retail Strips in the 6.7% (Vancouver) to 7.7% (Halifax) range.
</p>


<h2 style="clear:both;">Industrial</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R300&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=13"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/12.gif"></a>
Industrial properties remain highly ranked asset choices, but are still prone to the impact of vacancy, plant closures and reduced shipping requirements during tougher economic times. As a result, respondents conclude that, in some locations, there is downward pressure on rental rates and at best, only modest potential for rental increases. The highest growth in rental face rates are in Quebec City at 1.4% growth during the next 12 months, followed by Vancouver and Ottawa with modest increases. In the major manufacturing centres of Toronto and Montreal and energy-based Calgary and Edmonton, rents are predicted to shrink during the next 12 months. The 2-3 year outlook for face rate growth, while positive, is still very modest for all locations.

The graph to the right highlights the Valuation Parameters for Single Tenant Industrial. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Single Tenant Industrial range from 6.9% (Vancouver) to 8.5% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations, which have been less prone to the meltdown in the key manufacturing sector. During the last 12 month period, the majority of locations have improved in value, having experienced a decrease in required OCRs of 10 to 30 bps. The one exception was Calgary, where the required OCR increased by 10 bps over the last 12 months. In terms of Outlook, 25.7 % of respondents believe that Single Tenant Industrial values will increase during the next 12 months versus 19.2%, who forecast a decrease. In terms of yield requirements, the OCRs for Multi Tenant Industrial range from 6.9% (Vancouver) to 8.9% (Quebec City) and tend to be stronger in western locations. During the last 12 months, the majority of locations have improved in value. In Edmonton, the OCR range is from 7.0% to 8.3% and IRR range from 8.3% to 9.0%. This is closely supported by the January 2010 sale of the 107,690 sq ft Roper Ridge Business Park office warehouse complex in Edmonton for $23.5 million and demonstrating an OCR in the range of 7.25% and IRR in the range of 8.5%.

This asset class remains one of the most stable property investment types and produces the lowest yield rates in our survey. Sustained demand emanating from retirees and the growing generation "Y" cohort, produces stable vacancies and stable cash flows. This sector also benefits from low cost CMHC insured mortgage funding. However, despite a strong national profile, demand appears to be localized. The results for the last four quarters have not shown any consistency whatsoever. In Q4 2009, the strongest demand was in the Montreal market with 12.0 buyers for every seller, followed by Ottawa with 11.0 buyers for every seller. In this survey, Edmonton and Toronto with 5.0 buyers and for every seller command top position, with Montreal slipping to number 5 position with only 2.8 buyers for every seller. Unlike the last quarter, all markets are in positive territory with more buyers than sellers.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
<a href="/eng/chart/result.asp?market_0=3,2,11,6,5,7,4,1&amp;step=2&amp;report_0=R101&amp;period=112&amp;product_0=0&amp;property_0=15"><img width="180" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" alt="Click to see dynamic chart" src="static_en/image/2010_Q1/16.gif"></a>

The reported yield of OCRs range from a low of 5.4% in Vancouver to 7.2% in Halifax. This investment type has improved during the last 12 months, with reported OCRs being 10 to 30 bps higher than those reported in Q1 2009. The Alberta market results lag the country with Edmonton only up 10 bps and Calgary being down 10 bps over the last 12 months. Lower OCRs point to slightly higher unit values for Multi Family with unit rates generally being reported at $4,000 to $13,000 per suite higher than 12 months ago. The exceptions are Ottawa (down $3,000 per unit) and Edmonton (down $5,000 per unit), although the lack of a strong trading base makes per unit pricing imprecise.
</p>

<p style="clear:both;">
Multi Residential has demonstrated remarkable stability in yield requirements during the last 48 months, as illustrated by the historical performance of the Ottawa market. During the last 4 years the required OCR has flexed within a 40 bps range of 6.1% to 6.5%. Recently in Ottawa, the 270 unit Meadowbrook Manor sold at $90,700 per unit and an OCR slightly below the survey range of around 5.6%.
</p>



<h2 style="clear:both;">Summary</h2>

<p style="clear:both;">
The Q1 2010 Investment Trends Survey results indicate a strengthening recovery for the Canadian commercial investment real estate market. This survey conveys more optimism and less caution in terms of Outlook and gradually improving yield requirements. The "lagged" nature of the rebound is not unexpected given the lack of trading volume of commercial properties, compared to the more responsive residential market. Improved availability of mortgage financing and spreads is encouraging, but conservative lending parameters are keeping local and regional investors in check. The narrowing bandwidth of investment yields underscores that the gap between buyers and sellers is closing. Many qualified "cash" buyers continue to await potential distress opportunities, but these are largely relegated to smaller properties located in secondary markets.
