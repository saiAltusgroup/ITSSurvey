<h2>Overview and Background</h2>

<p>
The objective of the Investment Trends Survey is to study the perception of key decision makers and to interpret the trends that will impact on future markets.  We have conducted this survey since 1999 allowing us to provide a valuable historical perspective.
</p>

<p>
The questionnaire is distributed each quarter to professionals within the commercial real estate investment community in Canada and the broad range of respondents is considered by our statistician to be an accurate representation of the commercial real estate market.
</p>

<p>
We are pleased that a large proportion of the Canadian real estate community are not only contributors but also subscribers. Contributors to the survey include: Ownership Side of Pension Funds and Pension Fund Advisors, Publicly Traded Corporations/REITS, Ownership Side of Banks/Life Companies, Investment Banks/Real Estate Brokers /Real Estate Analysts, Private (Domestic) Companies, Private (Foreign) Companies, as well as the Lending Side of Banks/Life Companies/Pension Funds.
</p>

<p>
The results of the survey represent an informed consensus opinion and it is important to emphasize that caution is required with respect to the interpretation of valuation parameters set out herein. In today's rapidly changing investment market, survey results can lag actual transaction details and indicate lower/higher valuation parameters.
</p>

<p>
Originally published each quarter as a printed report containing colour charts with written summaries, the results of the surveys are now delivered online and provide subscribers with increased access to a wide range of colour charts, all of which can be downloaded from the site. In addition to the current quarter results, selected subscribers can access complete historical data on 12 different report types, covering the four major property types in eight markets across Canada.
