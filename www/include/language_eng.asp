As more information becomes available, participants have greater opportunity to weigh risk and respond, but the market remains imperfect. What is clear is that despite signs of growing economic weakness in Eastern Canada and sustained gloom from the United States, that the Canadian market is demonstrating surprising resilience and sustained demand for top quality assets.

During the last three quarters, the ITS results demonstrated remarkable resilience, reflected in a range of attitudes from caution and uncertainty to hints of confidence.

At the other end of the scale, prime assets are still in demand, but are attracting higher yield parameters and smaller pools of buyers.

For the first time in the history of ITS, the Location Barometer indicates bearish demand (more sellers than buyers) in all Canadian locations except Ottawa. The lack of available bank financing, coupled with growing economic weakness and unemployment, has dampened investor confidence in commercial real estate.

The nation’s capital, while not immune to the struggles associated with the waning US economy, is shielded by stable public administration employment and slightly positive GDP growth. Momentum indicators are extremely weak, with shallow demand (few buyers) and shallow supply (few sellers). In Ottawa the location barometer indicated one buyer for every seller and in Calgary, at number seven position, the barometer indicates there are 1.9 sellers for every buyer. Eastern cities of Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax are slightly bearish but stable.
